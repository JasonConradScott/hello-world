Appendix B   
The MICS Subsidiarv Tables 

8.0 GENERAL 
The subsidiary tables are INGRES tables wherein are stored changeable common data elements that are referenced 
by the Primary database tables and MICS programs, like VALIDATE and TSIP. (There are also other codes in 
MICS which are not kept in subsidiary database tables and are not changeable except by changing some of the 
MICS programs •• e.g. polarization codes), To update existing or add new data to these rnblcs the M!CS user will 
create and appropriate subsidiary update file. · 

The MICS microwave database currently contains 16 subsidiary data tables. These subsidiary data tables consist of 

descriptive info11nation and numerical data used in interference calculations and record keeping. the subsidiary data 

tables are the following: 
sd_ante, sd_antd, sd_anty Antenna information, discrimination, and description 
sd_band Frequency bands and band adjacency information, 

) 
) 
sd_eqpt Equipment description, 
sd_ctx, sd_ctxd Interference objectives tables, 
sd_note Notes table, 

sd_oper Information on operating and coordinating companies. 

sd_plan, sd_plnd Frequency plans. 

sd__rout Information on routes. 

sd_town Tower notes tables. 

sd_towp Description of tower types. 

sd traf Traffic types and cross references. 

B.O. l Maintenance ofthe Subsidjacy Tables 
The responsibility for maintaining the MDB subsidiary tables is shared by the users and FCSA central staff, The 
users are responsible for generating, processing and approving changes or additions to the tables: FCSA central 
staff (Database Administrator) is responsible for the administration and actual updating (i.e. operation of the 
programs to update the tables) of the tables, 

Modifying, adding or deleting information from a table may involve action by three parities: originator, 
coordinators and FCSA central staff, 

The originator can be any member company, e.g. a company using a new type of antenna or equipment should 
inhiate action towards including pertinent data into the subsidiary tables, 

TSIP Reference Manual B.0-1 'Winter 1995 


For certain subsidiary tables, as listed below, there are specified FCSA members, known as "Coordinators", who are 
responsible for verifying the newly created input information, in coordination \Vith the originator and FCSA central 

staff. Any changes to the subsidiary tables must be approved by the coordinators.

*Notes: The Note and Route tables are subdivided by company or call sign, therefore each MICS user is 
responsible for his/her company's table. FCSA looks after those ofnon-FCSA companies. 

Approval of codes suggested by the coordinators for the subsidiary data is the responsibility of the 
FCSADBA.

Input File to TSIP 

A.O GENERAL 
In MICS there is a common interface for entering microwave radio data into the database or for performing an 
interference analysis. This interface is the Primary Data File (pd!), since it relates to primary (as opposed to 
subsidiary) microwave radio data. The format of the microwave radio terrestrial station (TS pd!) is different to the 
earth station one (ES pd!). Although these file formats and their contents are discussed in detail in the MICS User 
Guide, some general principles and engineering calculations are discussed in this appendix. 

To optimize the interference calculations process and data retrieval, the structure of the pdf is hierarchical, or 
layered. Each layer in the pdfhas a one-to-one correspondence with an MDB relational table. For example, the site 
record is the top layer in the pdf and there is a corresponding table in the MDB -the site table. The site record (in 
Ingres table format) and the MDB site table have the same structure. 

With this hierarchical structure the interference analysis can be optimized since, for example, TSIP does not have to 
go beyond the site table to discard stations which are outside the coordination zone {the geographical coordinates of 
the microwave radio hop are stored in the site table). 

MDB data retrieval can also be optimized by subdividing the microwave radio primary data into smaller size tables. 
For example, all the channel information (frequency, TX Power, polarization, etc.) is stored in the channel table. 
Therefore, the program does not have to search in the other tables when it is retrieving channel data.

Al.O TS PDF STRUCTURE 

The TS pdf file can be stored in two ways: as a text, or "flat", file in a user's UNIX directory, or in Ingres relational 
tables, within the MICS system. 

The text file is subdivided into hierarchical records and there is a corresponding Ingres table for each one of the 
text-file records. There are 3 main Ingres tables for each TS pdf: site, antenna and channel. 

These 3 tables have corresponding records in the text-file pdf: the site, antenna and channel record, respectively. 
The Ingres pdf tables and text-file pdf can be converted one to each other by using the MICS Input/Export 
functions. Details as how to use these functions can be found in the MICS User Guide, section I.I. 

The highest hierarchical record in the TS pdf is the site record, followed by the antenna record and the channel 
record. MICS would allow a user to input to the database an antenna record without channel records, or a site 
record without antenna (and without channel) records, but not vice-versa. This is because a channel record must 
depend hierarchically upon an antenna record, and an antenna record upon a site record. 

The pdf Ingres tables are linked by using predefined key fields. 

The key filed of the TS site table is the site's call sign, or CALL I in MICS. Since this is the only key field of the 
site record, a call sign must not be repeated in MICS; a call sign must identify one and only one site. Licensed sites 
have call signs assigned by Industry Canada, which are unique. Microwave radio site data, however, is frequency 
inputted to the MICS database before a license is granted by IC, or the site may not require an IC license (passiv.e 
reflector sites, for example). MICS deals with this problem by allowing the users to use "fictitious" call signs. 
These fictitious call signs are assigned by the users, following the rules set by FCSA (see the MICS User Guide, 
Appendix A-6). 

) 

The keys of the pdfantenna table are: call sign (CALLI), remote site call sign (CALL2), antenna number (ANUM) 
and frequency band code (BNDCDE). CALLI links the antenna with the corresponding pdf site table. CALL2 
indicates which remote site this particular antenna is linking to, since a site can have several antennas pointing in 
different directions. BNDCDE identifies the frequency band of the antenna and ANUM the number cifthis particular 
antenna. Note that MICS requires that the set of 4 keys be unique. The antenna number, for example, could be 
repeated for a different remote site (i.e. the same CALLI but two different CALL2 remotes). 

The keys of the pdf channel table are: call sign (CALLI), remote site call sign (CALL2), frequency band code 
(BNDCDE) and channel identification code (CHID). CALL I links the pdf channel table with the pdf site table. 
CALL2 identifies the remote station the channel is going to or coming from. BNDCDE identifies the particular 
frequency band of the channel, since the microwave radio site could operate in several bands. CHID identifies a 
particular channel within the specified frequency band and between the stations identified by CALL I and CALL2. 
Again, as in the case of the antenna table, the set of 4 keys has to be unique. 

An example ofa TS pdfin text-file "short" format is presented on Table A.1.0-1, an the same file in "long" format is 
presented on Table A. 1.0-2.

Example of TS pdftext-file for "flat" file) in "short" format 

The first two lines, on Table A.1.0-1, are the title record of the file. 

The site records are identified by the first character "S". This file corresponds to a single two-way microwave 
hop.There are, then two site records (site A and site B in this example). The site reocrd has 2 lines: SK and SD. 
The SK line contains the key field, CALLI, which are =UNKNA for site A and =UNKNB for site B in this 
example. Note that both call signs are fictitious, as indicated by the first character (the "=" sign). The blank spaces 
separated with commas correspond to optional fields which are not filled in by the user. The antenna records are 
identified by the first character "A". The antenna record in the short-format file has 2 lines: AK and AQ. The AK 
line contains the keys to th.e pdf antenna table. In the first antenna record they are: =UNKNA (CALLI), =UNKNB 
(CALL2), 12 (BNDCDE) and I (ANUM). It is interesting to note in this example that the second antenna record 
has the keys =UNKNA, =UNKNB, 12 and 2. The only difference with the keys of the first antenna is the antenna 
number (2 in this latter cast). This indicates that both antennas are operating between the same two sites (=UNKNA 
is the local site and =UNKNB is the remote site) and in the same frequency band (MICS band code 12). But the 
antenna use code field of antenna #' I is "TR" (first field after AQ in the AQ line of the antenna record) and the 
antenna use code of antenna #2 is DVI. Then, antenna #I is the main transmit/receive antenna and antenna #2 is 
the first receive-diversity antenna of this microwave radio link. 

Spring 1996 A.1-2 TSIP Reference Manual 


The channel records are identified by the first character "C". The channel record in the short-fonnat TS pdfhas 4 
lines: CK, CT, CR and CQ. The CK line contains the keys to the pdf channel table. In the first channel record of 
this example the keys are: =UNKNA (CALLI), =UNKNB (CALL2), 12 (BNDCDE) and IA (CHID). Note that the 
transmit frequency (6905000.0 in the first CT record of this example) and the receive frequency (6565000.0 in the 
first CR record of this example) are in kHz. The transmit power (3 1.0 in the first CT record of this example) and 
the receive power (-31.3 in the first CQ record of this example) are in dBm. 

The long-fonnat TS pdf is presented on Table A. 1.0-2. The difference between this file and the corresponding 
short-format file, is that all optional fields are displayed in the long fonnat. In the long-fonnat the antenna record 
has 3 lines: AK, AQ, and AO. All optional fields not displayed in the short fonnat will be displayed on the AO line 
(all are blank in this particular example). 

The channel record in the long-fonnat TS pdf has 5 line: CK, CT, CR, CQ and CO. Again, all optional fields not 
displayed on the short-fonnat will be displayed on the CO line. Only the "In service Date" field was filled in by the 
user in this particular example.

A2.0 ES PDF Structure 

The ES pdf file can be stored in two ways: as a text, or "flat", file in a user's UNIX directory, or in Ingres relational 
tables, within the MICS system. The text file is subdivided into hierarchical records and there is a corresponding 
Ingres table for each one of the test-file records. The ES pdfflat-file has 4 main records: site, antenna, azimuth and 
channel. Theses 4 records have corresponding ES pdf Ingres tables: site, antenna, azimuth and channel tables 
respectively. The Ingres ES pdf tables and pdf text-file can be converted one to each other by using the MICS 
Import/Export functions. Details as how to use these functions can be found in the MICS User Guide, section 1.2. 

The antenna record is hierarchically dependent upon the site record, and the azimuth and channel records are 
hierarchically dependent upon the antenna record. MICS would allow a user to input to the database an antenna 
record without channel and/or azimuth record, or a site record without an antenna record, but not vice-versa. 

As mentioned before, the 4 main tables which compose the ES pdf (in Ingres format) are the site, antenna, azimuth 
and channel tables. These tables are linked one to each other by pre-defined key fields. 

The key of the ES site table is the LOCATION code. This code is assigned by the user and must be unique within 
the MICS database, since a LOCATION code must identify one and only one ES site. 

The keys of the ES antenna table are the LOCATION code, the call sign (CALLI) and the frequency band code 
(BNDCDE). Note that within the MICS ES environment there is a one to one correspondence between the earth 
station and the call sign. Before a license is granted by Industry Canada the users are allowed to use fictitious call 
signs to input ES data tot he MICS database. The first character of these fictitious call signs is a special characters. 
For rules governing the use of fictitious call signs see the MICS User Guide, Appendix A-6. 

In the ES MICS environment, the antenna record may have 2 band codes. For example, an ES operating in the 6/4 
GHz bands, will have 6 GHz MICS band code for the transmit band and the MICS 4 GHz band code for the receive 
band. The set of the 3 antenna keys has to be unique within the MICS data set, to identify one and only one 
antenna. The keys of the ES azimuth table are the LOCATION code, the call sign (CALLI) and the value of the 
azimuth point. Then, an azimuth record within the azimuth table, is linked to the antenna and site table by the 
LOCATION and CALLI keys, and singled out by the value of the particular azimuth angle. 

The keys of the ES channel re the LOCATION code, call sign (CALLI) and channel identification code (CHIO). 
The set of the 3 channel keys has to be unique, within the MICS database, to identify one and only one channel. 

An example ofan ES file in text-format is presented on Table A.2.0-1. The first 3 lines of the file are the name and 
title record. The site record is identified by the first character "S". The ES pdf site record has 2 lines: SK and SD. 
The SK line contains the site record keys, =ESDI in this example.

Example of ES PDF in text !"flat-file"} format 

The antenna record is identified by the first character "A". The ES antenna record has 4 lines: AK, AT, AR and 
AS. The LOCATION and CALLI keys are in the AK record (=ESOI and =TELSOI respectively), the transmit band 
code (11) is in the transmit antenna record (AT), and the receive band code (09) is in the receive antenna record 
(AR). 

The azimuth record is identified by the first character "Z". All azimuth records are "ZK" and the number of records 
will be equal to the number of azimuth points. For example, a user has inputted one azimuth point-every 5 degrees, 
then, there will be 72 azimuth records (360/5). The keys of the first-azimuth point are {=ESOI, =TELSOI, 0.00). 
The keys of the second azimuth point are {=ESOI, =TELSOI, 110.72), and so on. The channel records are 
identified by the first character "C". The ES channel record has 3 lines: CK, CT and CR. The keys of the channel 
record are in the CK line; =ESOI, =TELSOI and 001, for the first channel record. Note that the transmit and receive 
frequencies, 63 85000.0 and 4160000.0 in the CT and CR records respectively, are in kHz. The powers are in dBw, 

e.g. 26.0 in the CT record, -120.0 in the CRreocrd.

A3.l Distance and Azimuth Calculation 

The microwave radio path length, or "distance" in MICS, is calculated by program VALIDATE from the site

Az= SM-8/2 
B.Az =Az + 8 + 1t

2. For L>$ < 0 and L,'/,.,;; 0 
Az = 211 -SM-8/2 
B.Az=Az+ 8 +11 
3. For L>$:?: 0 and L,'/,. <0 ~ 
Az=11+SM-8~/ 
B.Az=Az+ 8 +11 
4. For L>$:?: 0 andl>'/,.:?: 0 
Az=11-Sm-8/2 
B.Az=Az+ i', +11 
Where 
8 = L,'/,. Sin $m 
SM is in radians 

Note that in each ofthe above four cases ifthe B.Az:?: 211, then B.Az = B.Az -211 

A3.1.3 Calculation of Antenna Elevation Angle 

The antenna elevation angle, with respect to the local horizon, is calculated by routine ELANGT of program 
INVPOS. 

ELANGT computes the apparent elevation angle for an unobstructed radio ray traveling between two sites when the 
apparent earth radius factor k = 4/3. 

) The computations are: 

Do = D/R0 
Do

A1 =

H2 -H1 

1 )
A2 = arctan ( 
(2KR0 )+H1 +H2 tanA1 

180 

E12 = (A2 -A1) 


7! 

180 

E21 = (-A2 -A1) 


7! 

In the above,

R0 
D = path distance, km 

= path distance, radians. 

D0 
H1 = antenna center line height at site I, km AMSL. 

H2 = antenna center line height at site 2, km AMSL. 
K = apparent earth radius factor, taken to be 4/3.

elevation angle at station 1 facing station 2, degrees (positive up). 
elevation angle at station 2 facing station 1, degrees (positive up). 

It should be noted that ELANGT does not consider whether the radio path is obstructed, i.e. ELANGT does not 
yield that elevation angle to the horizon if the radio path is obstructed, and other computations are necessary in such 

a case. 

A3.2 Calculation of Receive Power 
The receive power is also calculated by program VALIDATE. Thepower is calculated as follows: 
pwr(Rx) =pwr(Tx) -afsltxl + again(Tx) 

-(Free space Loss)+ again(Rx) -afsl(Rx) 
Where: 
pwr(Rx) receive power (main or diversity as applicable), in dBm 
pwr(Tx) transmit power, in dBm 
afsltxl main transmit antenna feeder system loss, in dB 
again(Tx) main transmit antenna gain, dBi

A4.0 ES PDF SPECIAL CALCULATIONS 

A4.l Elevation and Azimuth Angle to Satellite 

For geosynchronous satellites, VALIDATE calculates the elevation angle and azimuth from the ES to the satellite. 
These calculations are based on the ES coordinates and satellite longitude entered by the user and on a default. 
atmospheric refractivity index equal to 330. 

The algorithm used to calculate the azimuth is: 

Az(ES) = arctan {tan(DLONG) / Sin (ESLAT)} + 180 
where: 

Az (ES): azimuth from the ES to the satellite, in degrees from North 
DLONG: difference between the satellite longitude and the earth station longitude, in degrees 
ESLAT: ES latitude, in degrees 
The non-refracted elevation angle from the ES to the satellite, Elev (ES), is calculated as: 

Elev(ES) = arctan {K/tan(B/2)} -B/2 

where 

B = arctan {tan(ESLTD)/cos[Az (ES)-180]} 
R-Ro-HG -HA

) 
K= 

R+Ro+HG+HA 
R = 42230 (km) 
Ro = 6373 (km) 
HG = ES site altitude (ams!), in km 
HA = antenna center-line height (agl), in km 
The non refracted elevation angle is corrected by refraction and this corrected elevation angle is used by MICS. The 

refraction correction is a non-linear function of the antenna elevation angle and it is calculated using an iterative 
process. 

A4.2 ES Antenna Maximum Horizon Gain 

Program VALIDA TE calculates the ES antenna maximum gain towards the local horizon. The antenna maximum 
horizon gain is calculated in the vertical plane which contains the antenna main beam vector, since this will 
correspond to the minimum discrimination angle. This angle is, in fact, the difference between the elevation to the 
satellite and the elevation towards the local horizon (determined from the ES azimuth record). VALIDATE 
retrieves from the antenna subsidiary table, the antenna discrimination corresponding to the calculated 
discrimination angle. Then, this discrimination is subtracted from the maximum antenna gain and the result is the 
maximum antenna gain towards the local horizon. This calculation is done for the Tx and Rx antenna patterns.

A5.0 PASSIVE REPEATERS CONSIDERATIONS 

Sites involving passive repeaters have to follow special rules in MICS. These rule are explained in the following 
paragraphs. 

A5.l Types of Passive Repeaters 

Passive repeaters used in MICS are of two types: 

a) those involving bill-board type passive reflectors, 
b) those involving pairs of antennas connected back-to-back. 
In either case, a or b, passive repeaters are entered into a PDF by simulating a virtual active station at the location of 
the passive repeater. Records should be entered in the PDF and fields should be filled out, as if the passive repeater 

were a conventional active station. 

A5.2 Conventions Concerning Bill-Board Passives Only 

The following conventions apply to bill-board type passive repeaters; 

the call sign of the station must begin with the "%" character, e.g. %OPER00 I, where OPER is a 
MICS valid operator-code; 
a given passive call sign can refer to only one passive reflector site, linked to two ( and only tow) 
active stations, which are interconnected through the passive. This means that if there is more than one 
passive at a given geographical location (e.g. a double passive) each passive reflector must be given its 
own "%'' call sign; 
the passive reflector antenna code must end with the"%" character (see Appendix B, paragraph B.1.8); 
the passive receive and (virtual) transmit power, to the other passive link, are calculated by program 
Validate, from the active site data, passive size and path geometry. 

A5.3 Conventions Concerning Back-to-Back Antenna Passives 

The following conventions apply to back-to-back antennas passive repeaters; 

the call sign of the station must begin with the';' character, e.g. ;OPER00l, where OPER is a MICS 

valid operator-code; 

the loss in the connection between the two antennas is assumed to be 0(dB); 
the receive and transmit power at the virtual active repeater (at the passive site) have to be calculated 
by the user and put on the corresponding fields of the PDF. 

A5.4 Conventions Concerning the Virtual Active Repeater 

The following conventions should be followed to input the virtual active repeater data (i.e. repeater assumed to be at 
the passive repeater site). If the passive link is Active #1 (Al), Passive (P), Active #2 (A2) then: 

the passive site is subdivided into two virtual links, P-Al and P-A2; 

Fall 1997 A.5-1 TSIP Reference Manual 


the receiver of the link Al-P (at the passive site) is the same receiver type ofA2; 
the receiver of the link A2-P (a the passive site) is the same receiver type of Al; 
the transmitter of the link P-A2 (at the passive site) is the same transmitter type of A I; 
the transmitter of the link P-Al (at the passive site) is the same transmitter type of A2; 
this same idea (of transmitter and receiver types), applies to all fields which "propagate" through the 
link, like traffic code for example; 
the transmit and receive antenna gain, in the case ofthe bill-board passive type, are equal to one-halfof 
the passive reflector gain; 
the transmit and receive antenna gain, for the back-to-back antenna repeater, are equal to the actual 
antenna gains used in the link. 

As mentioned before, the transmit and receive powers, at the virtual active repeater, are calculated by Validate in the 
case of the bill-board passive. In the back-to-back antenna repeater, the user has to calculate them. Note that, since 
no loss is assumed in the connection between the antennas, for example the transmit power of the link P-A2 (at the 
passive) is equal to the receive power of the link Al-P (at the passive site)

ES-TS TSIP EXAMPLE USING SPHERICAL EARTH PROPAGATION LOSS 

4.10 

4.10.1 ISIP Parameter Fi)es 
TSIP ES-TS allows the user to select one of two available propagation loss algorithms: MICS default method 
(based on a CCIR SJM Report of 1972) and the "spherical earth" method (based on CCIR Report 715-1). The 
propagation loss model is selected on the TSIP parameter file screen. 

The TSIP parameter file screen using the MICS default method is presented on Table 4.10.IA. Note that the 
"spherical Earth Cale?" field value is "N'', which is the TSIP default value (this means that the spherical earth 
method will not be used). 

The TSIP parameter file screen using the spherical earth propagation method is presented on Table 4.10.IB. The 
only difference with the previous screen is that the "spherical Earth Cale? field value has been changed to "Y".

4.10.2 ISIP Study Repgrts 
The TSIP study report using the MICS default propagation loss method is presented on Table 4.10.2A, and the 
report using the spherical earth is presented on Table 4.10.2B. There is an important difference between these two 
reports: the MICS default method predicts 5 TS into ES interference cases and the spherical earth method predicts 
12 cases. (This is certainly an ambiguous situation. At the time of writing this manual there is an open MICS 
Technical Group issue concerning over the horizon propagation loss calculation methods).

4.10.3 ISIP Interference Analysis Reports 
To illustrate the difference between these two calculation methods, TS into ES Case #1 of both reports will be 
compared to each other. 

TS into ES Case #1 of the report using the MICS default method is presented on Table 4.10.3A, and the one using 
the spherical earth method on Table 4.10.3B. 

Both reports are identical up to the point where the long term calculated propagation loss (Loss dB), 20%S. (Third 
line from the bottom of the report). Using the MICS default method the calculated value is 204.14 (dB), and using 
the spherical earth method the value is 152.30 (dB). This translates into a positive margin of22.94 (dB) becoming a 
negative margin of28.90 (dB) (i.e. -28.90 dB).

TSIP ORBIT INTERSECTION ANALYSIS EXAMPLE 

4.9.1 

Orbit Intersection Analysis Example 

A terrestrial link operating in a frequency band shared with the satellite service, should be analyzed for orbit 
intersection. This can be done directly from the TSIP parameter screen. 

As an example, a TS file named "orbit", Table 4.9.1, will be submitted to orbit intersection analysis (the coordinates 
of the sites in this file have been modified to obtain an orbit intersection case). The microwave links in this file 
operate in the 6 GHz band, which is shared with the satellite service.

Note that "Y" (yes) has been inputted in the "TSORB Cale?" parameter file field. Also, no interference analysis is 
desired in this particular case, therefore the coordination distance has been set to 0km. 

The TSIP study report ofthis example is presented on Table 4.9.3. It is interesting to note the following: 

Geostationary Orbit Study (YIN): y 
Coordination Distance (km): 0.000 
Orbit Report: y 
Number ofstations passed (to analysis): 0 

The number of station pairs passed to analysis must be zero, since the coordination distance is Okm.

TSIP Study Report ofOrbit Intersection on Example 

TSIP Reference Manual 4.9-5 Summer1995 


The orbit intersection report (XXX.ORBIT) is presented on Table 4.9.4. The 2 south (south-east more exactly) 
pointing links were analyzed by the program. The first hop, Highland-Radnor, did not intersect the geostationary 

orbit (the report indicates that the antenna main beam points ·below the sea level horizon). The second link 
intersects the geostationary satellite orbit. 

The report presents, first, a summary of the input data (station name, latitude, longitude, ground elevation and 
antenna height). Then the calculated hop distance, azimuth and antenna elevation angle. If there is no orbit 
intersection, the program will print a note indicating this. Ifthere is orbit intersection, the orbit intersection report is 
produced by the system.

Orbit Intersection Reports 

The result of computations for each link in the pdf is reported by ORBIT, whether or not there is an intersection 
with the geostationary satellite orbit. The report will take one of the following ten different fonns, depending on the 

results. 
Report Fonn I A 
Example: 
(No Intersection) 
ALPHA TO BRAVO 
LATITUDE 46 33 45 N 46 33 30 N 
LONGITUDE 75 41 35 W 75 11 38 W 
GROUND ELEV A TION, AMSL 300 M, 984 FT 400M, 1312 FT 
ANTENNA HEIGHT, AGL 35 M, 115 FT 57M, 187FT

AZIMUTH 90.51 DEG 
ELEV A TION ANGLE 0.050 DEG 

POINTS ABOVE THE REFRACTED GEOSTATIONARY ORBIT (N=400). 
MINIMUM ANGULAR SEPARATION IS GREATER THAN 5 DEGREES. 

In this case, the link points more than 5 degrees north ofthe No= 400 orbit trace, measured along the assumed radio 
horizon (the adjacent station's ground elevation). 

The actual radio horizon, if it dips below the assumed radio horizon between the adjacent station and the No = 400 
orbit trace, may give rise to separations less than the reported parameters expected in practice. 

Report Fonn 1B 

This is generally similar to Form IA.

POINTS ABOVE THE REFRACTED GEOSTATIONARY ORBIT (N=250). 
MINIMUM ANGULAR SEPARATION IS GREATER THAN 5 DEGREES. 

In this case, the link points more than 5 degrees south of the No = 250 orbit trace, measured perpendicular to the 
orbit. The actual radio horizon may block the intersection if it rises behind the adjacent station.

,, This represents an intersection. The link points within 2 degrees north of the No = 400 orbit trace, measured along 
the assumed radio horizon. The actual separation may be less than the reported separation if the actual radio horizon 

is below the assumed radio horizon and this should be checked as described more fully under REPORT FORM 2A2. 

In this report are included maximum admissible EIRP values calculated in accordance with CCIR Rec. 406-4 for the 
bands 1-10, 10-15 and above 15 GHz. These are calculated for the reported separation; if the actual separation is 
small due to the shape ofthe actual horizon, you should recalculate the EIRP values. 

Note for 3A and 3B, if actual radio horizon rises above the assumed radio horizon the actual radio horizon may 
block the intersection. 

Also included are the "critical azimuths" (azimuths within which the link cannot avoid a ± 2 degree intersection at 
the given link elevation angle), and the "critical longitudes (orbital longitudes included within a ± 2 degree 
intersection at the given in azimuth and elevation).

TSIP TEMPORARY DATA EXAMPLE 

Temporary Data in ISIP 

TSIP allows the user to execute a study using subsidiary data not yet posted to the SDB, or "temporary" subsidiary 
data as it is called in MICS. The temporary subsidiary data that can be used is: antenna, equipment, CTI{ and 
frequency plan. 

To go to the TSIP temporary data screens, the user has to select number 2, "TSIP Temporary Tables", on the "TSIP 
Functions and Auxiliary Programs" screen (screen 3.0). After this menu entry is selected, the system will display 
the TSIP Temporary tables screen, presented on table 4.8. !A.

If the user selects "Antenna Tables", for example, the system will display the "Temporary SDF Antenna Files" 
screen (screen 3.2.1), presented on Table 4.8.IB. This screen presents to the user a list of existing temporary 
antenna files and also gives the user the option ofcreating new temporary antenna files.

The user can then proceed to enter the temporary antenna data and "ADD" it when completed (#3 on the number 
pad). 

ISIP Temporary Data Code Rules 

There is one basic rule for all temporary data codes used in TSIP: they must start with the "$" sign. This will 
indicate to TSIP to look for that code in the user's temporary data file and not in the SDB. Note that the temporary 
data file names shall not start with the "$" sign. 

The temporary codes should, of course, conform to the maximum number of characters allowed for that particular 
type of code (including the $ sign character). 

For the antenna temporary codes there is one additional rule: the last 3 characters should be the antenna gain, with 
one decimal place but without".". For example: $TEMPANT412 would be a valid temporary code for an antenna 
where gain is 41.2 dB.

4.8.5. ISIP Temporary Data Parameter File 
In this example the pdf of Table 4.8.4 is being submitted to interference analysis. Note that after validation this pdf 
has a status "T'', which means it is valid for TSIP only, since it has temporary codes. 

The TSIP parameter file of this example is presented on Table 4.8.5. Since the pdf contains a temporary antenna 
code, the file name ofthis temporary antenna, "tsant", has been inputed on the "Temp Ante Table" field ofthe TSIP 
parameter screen. Then TSIP will look for the pattern ofthe temporary antenna in this file and not in the subsidiary 
database.

ISIP INTRA Example Study Report 

The study report ofthis example is presented on Table 4.7.3. Note that "INTRA" is listed as environment type. 

The number of station groups passed to analysis is 8 and the number of interference cases is 2. Depending on the 
file submitted to analysis, not all pairs of stations may be analyzed. For example, a IO hop file is sumbitted to 
analysis and a coordination distance of 200 km is selected. The distance between site # I and site #6 of this file, for 
example, could be greater than 200 km, and therefore TSIP would not pass this pair ofstations to analysis.

4.7.4 TSIP INTRA Example Interference Report 
The TSIP interference report ofthis example is presented on Table 4.7.4. 

The first interference case reported is link CHB895-to-CHB896 interfering into link CHB897-to-CHB896. That is, 
station CHB896 is receiving from both directions, and they interfere on to each other. Remember this is a fictitious 
case, since the channel added to the file (6920 MHz) does not conform to the freqency plan. Interference is reported 
into the main and diversity antennas at CHB896. 

The second case corresponds to CHB896 transmitting to CHB897 and receiving from CHB895. This case also 
involves the (fictitious) channel at 6920 MHz.

ISIP INTRA Example Interference Report 

4.7.5 TSIP HandHn~ ofCollocated Antennas 
In the second interference case ("Case Number:2") of the INTRA TSIP interference report of Table 4.7.4, the Tx 
antenna to CHB897 and the receiving antenna from CHB895 are in the same tower. TSIP will read the same 
coordinates (latitude and longitude) for both antenna and will determine the distance between them is zero. This is 
in fact reported, since the 1-Vrx distance is 0.00 km. But, because ofthis, TSIP cannot determine the geometry of 
the case and calculate the antenna discrimination angles. Therfore, the MICS Technical Group agreed to set the 
Vrxmagnitude ofthe discrimination angle equal to 90 degrees, for both, intefering and victim antennas. Ifthe user 
fmds one ofthes cases, these discrimination angles should be taken as a warning and the case should be analyzed in 
more detail.

4.6.2 ISIP Parameter Files 
This interference analysis could be done using either file, TS or ES, as proposed file and the other one as 
environment. Obviously the results of the interference analysis should be the same, there are, however, some 
differences in the parameter files. The TSIP parameter file using the TS as the proposed file is presented on Table 
4.6.2.A, and the parameter file using the ES as proposed file is presented on table 4.6.2B.

ISIP Parameter File Using the ES as Proposed File 
Other than the pdf types and names (which are interchanged) there are two other differences between these 
parameter files. In Table 4.6.2B the TSORB Cale. field is blank, since the ES file cannot be analyzed for orbit 
intersection. Also, the coordination distance field is blank, since the coordination distance is a given in the proposed 
ES file. 
4.6.3 TS-pdf Against ES-pdfISIP Study Report. 
The TSIP study report using the TS as proposed file is presented on Table 4.6.3A, and the one using the ES as 
propsed file on Table 4.6.3B. 
The file names and types are, of course, interchanged in these 2 reports. Thus, in the first case the file type is "T' 
and the environment is PDF_ ES; in the second case the file types is "E" and the environment is PDF_ TS. 
The coordination distance in the TS-pdf as proposed file is 300 km. In the ES-pdf case there are 4 coordination 
distances (all equal to 300 km in this example,. in -0rder to get the same results). The distances could be set 
individually in the ES pdf. In this case, using the ES-pdf as proposed file might offer more flexibility in this type of

The number of stations passed to analysis (since the coordination distances are equal) and reported interefernce cases 

must be the same. As indicated before, the ES does not receive in the 6 GHz band, therefeore the number of TS into 

ES cases passed to analysis is zero. 

The number of ES into TS cases passed to anslysis is 2 (in both reports) and the number ofitnerference cases is I. 

The interference analysis report is not different to the TS against ES MDB example and it will not be discussed here.

TS FILE AGAINST TS FILE INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS 

4.5.1 Input Files 
In this example the operl pdf(Table 4.3.1) is analyzed against another pdffile. This second file was created using a 
microwave hop from the list ofstations passed to analysis ofTable 4.3.2.3; specifically the interference case hop 
reported by TSIP in the example ofoperl against the MDB. This second file is called cfw 303 and is presented on 
Table 4.5.1. Therefore, in this example, operl will be the proposed file and the cfw303 pdfwill be the environment. 
Ofcourse both files have to be valid for TSIP analysis.

The main differences with respect to the pdfagainst MDB case are: 

Environment type is now PDF_TS, 
Environment Name is cfw303 {pdf file name), 
Number ofstations passed to analysis is 4. 

Note that the environment pdf could contain more than one operator code; therefore ALL operator codes is a valid 
input parameter in this type ofanalysis. The same is valid concerning the CALL signs ofthe environment file.

EXAMPLE OF TS-ES INTERFERENCE ANALSYIS 

4.4.1 General 
There are four possible analysis cases: 
-terrestrial (TS) pdf file against earth stations (ES) database; 
-TS pdf against ES pdf; 
-ES pdf against terrestrial database; and 
-ES pdf against TS pdf. 

Examples of these analysis cases are presented and discussed in this section. 

4.4.2 TS File A~ainst ES MDB 
The TS pdf file can be analyzed against the terrestrial MDB in Band or Plan/Channel (P/C) modes. Examples of 
both cases are discussed later in this section. 

4.4.2.1 ISIP pdf)nput File 
The TS pdf used in this TS file into ES MDB study is presented in Table 4.4.2.1. The file created for this example 
has channels in the 4 GHz band, MICS band code 09, and channels in the 6 GHz band, MICS band code 11. This 
has been done to obtain TS and ES as well as ES into TS cases in this example. 

4.4.2.2 ISIP Parameter file 
TSIP parameter file for Band analyis is presented in Table 4.4.2.2A, and the parameter file for P/C analysis is 
presented in Table 4.4.2.2.B.

In the example ofTable 4.4.2.2C, the oper2b parameter file is being sumitted to anlaysis. This file has been selected 
by moving the cursor down to its position (using the Tab and arrow keys) and by depressing the "Ins" key on the 
number pad. The "*" character besides the file indicates this file has been selected. To submit this parameter file in 
batch mode, the user has to return the cursor to the "Destination Filename" field and type the destination filename. 
In this example the destination file name is "te". TSIP will use this filename to construct the table and report file 
names. The report file names in this example will be: 

te_oper2b_b.NNN, where 

NNN stands for the extension names of each one ofthe four reports (e.g. EXEC, STIJDY). 

To submit the file in batch mode the user will depress number 2 on the number pad; or depress number I if the 
study is being submitted interactively. 

4.4.2.3 TSIP TS-ES Execution Report Example 
The Band Analysis execution report of this example is presented on Table 4.4.2.3A, and the P/C analysis report is 
presented on Table 4.4.2.3B. Both reports are identical, except for the report names and number of interference 

J 
J 
cases. 

TSIP Reference Manual 4.4-5 Summer1995 


The report names are created by TSIP using the prefix "te" (for terrestrial-earth stations analysis) followed by the 
parameter file names were oper2b and oper2pc, for the Band and P/C analysis respectively. The corresponding 

TSIP run names were "b" and "pc". The name extensions identify each one of the 4 reports. 

There is a greater number of interference cases in the Band analysis than in the P/C analysis. This should be 
expected, since Band is a worst case analysis type. 

Note that the station groups passed to analysis and the number of interference cases are reported individually for 
TS-ES and ES-TS. This is because the ES Station transmits and receives in different frequency bands, i.e. 6GHz 
and 4GHz in this example. The number of TS-ES stations groups passed to analysis is, then, the number of 4GHz 
TS hops analyzed against 4GHz ES receiving station (i.e. in this example the groups are site A transmitting to site B 
against a receiving earth station in the ES MDb, and site B transmitting to site A against a receiving earth station in 
the ES MDB). ES-TS stations groups passed to analysis are, in this example, formed by an earth station 
transmitting in the 6GHz band in the ES MDB interfering into site A receiving from site B, or site B receiving from 
site A).

Analysis Type: P/C Plan/channel analysis was requested in this case. 

Channel Status Codes (0-9): 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 All status codes were requested in the TSIP parameter file. 
In P/C analysis TSIP is sensitive to channel status codes. 

Number ofTS Cases: Note that only I TS into ES case is reported in P/C analysis, 
as compared to 8 cases in Band analysis. 

Number ofES Cases: 5 5 ES into TS cases, as compared to 19 in Band Analysis. 
The greater number in Band is due to the fact that Band is a 
worst case analysis type.

TS-ES P/C Analysis Example 

4.4.2.5 Summary ofStations Submitted to Analysis Report Example 
The TSIP report of stations passed to analysis is presented on Tables 4.4.2.5A and 4.4.2.5B. The Band and P/C 
reports are identical in this example, since the coordination distance is the same and the frequency band is the same 
in both cases. 

Table 4.4.2.5 is the TS into ES part of the report, that is, potential interfering TS stations against stations from the 
ES MDB. Table 4.4.2.5B is the ES into TS part of the report, that is, potential interfering ES stations against 
stations ofthe TS pdf. 

In the TS-ES report the TS stations are listed on the left side ofthe page and the ES stations on the right side. In the 

~~~~--~ 0 

It should be pointed out that in some cases both ends ofthe TS hop are printed, in others only one site of the hop is 
printed. In this latter case, this is because the distance between a particular ES station and the other end of the hop 
is greater than the selected coordination distance. 

(Please note that the original TSIP report of stations passed to analysis has been edited to present it in this manual).

ES File Against TS MDB 

4.4.3.1 ES PDF Input Fi)e 
In this example an ES pdf, es0I presented in table 4.4.3.1, is analyzed against the TS MDB. Note that this earth 
station has transmit channels in the 6 GHz band and receive channels in the 4 GHz band. In fact TSIP analyses the 
transmit and receive directions and produces two separate interference reports, TS into ES and ES into TS. The list 
of stations passed to analysis is also separated into two reports, since the ES transmit direction may interfere with 
TS 6GHz receivers, and the ES receiver may be interfered by TS 4 GHz transmitters in the coordination area.

ES pdf Against TS MDB Execution Re.port Example 

As explained in previous examples, TSIP constructs the report file names using the destination file name (te) as 
prefix and the TSIP run name as suffix. It is interesting to note that, in this particular example, there are 80 TS 
receivers operating within the coordination area in the 6 GHz band, and only 25 TS 4 GHz transmitters in the same 
area. Out of these 25 TS potential interferers there were no interference cases. The ES station, however is 
interfering into one 6 GHz TS receiver.

4.4.3.4 ISIP TS-ES Study Report 0 
The study report ofthis TSIP example is presented on Table 4.4.3.4. The filed-by-field discussion ofthis report has 
been done in previous examples. Only a comment concerning the coordination distance will be made here. The 
reports lists 4 coordination distances ("Tx Tropospheric Dist.", Tx Precipitation Dist.", "Rx Tropospheric Dist." and 
"Rx Precipitation Dist."). Although the four ofthem are equal to 300 km in this example, this is not necessarily the 
case. The user could change anyone of them in the ES pdf being submitted to analysis for example, the user could 
decide to extend the Tx coordination distances to 400 km. TSIP would then retrieve all the 6 GHz TS stations 
within a circle of400 km radius centered on the ES. If the Rx distances are left at 300 km, then TSIP would look 
for TS 4 GHz stations within a circle of 300 km centered on the ES.

4.4.3.5 Summary ofStation Submitred to Analysis Report Example 
The list of TS into ES stations passed to analysis is presented on Table 4.4.3.5A and the ES into TS on Table 

4.4.3.5B. Note that the transmitting station (ES or TS) is identified in the heading of the report. Also, the transmit 

stations are listed on the left side ofthe report (in the ES-TS case it is only the ES station). 

A station group passed to analysis is, in this case, the ES station and one from the TS list. In the TS into ES case 
there are 25 TS stations; therefore there are 25 groups of stations passed to analysis (since there is only I ES). This 
figure is reported in the "study" report. In the ES-TS case, this figure is 80 groups.

4.4.3.6 ISIP JS-ES Detailed Report oflnterference Cases Example 
The ES into TS interference study report is presented on table 4.4.3.6A, and the TS into ES on Table 4.4.3.6B. The 
second line ofthe report indicates which one ofthe reports it is. For example, the report of Table 4.4.3.6A second 
line reads: "ES to TS Interference Study Report-Case Detail". This report is similar to the one presented on section 
4.4.2.6, and will not be discussed further here. 

It should be pointed out that the TS into ES interference report is blank (Table 4.4.3.6B). This is because there are 
no TS into ES interference cases in this particular example. The last line ofthe report indicates there are no cases 
reported. It was decided to print these reports (even if they are blank) for those cases where the user did no 

requested the 'Execution" and the "study" reports, thus the user would not know ifthere are no interference cases or 
the report is missing for other reasons.

EXAMPLE OF TS-TS INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS 

4.3.0 Introduction 
In this section the terrestrial-to-terrestrial microwave radio interference analysis performed by TSJP is discussed in 
detail. 

For simplicity ofthe analysis a single hop test file is used in the examples. This is done, however, without loosing 
generality, since all practical cases are addressed. 

4.3.1 TS-TS TSJP Input FHe Example 
The TS pdfused in the examples ofthis section is reproduced on Table 4.3.1. it is a single channel, single hop pdf, 
operating in the 6 GHz frequency band. Site A has a receive diversity antenna; site B has only the main antenna.

4.3.2 TS-TS TSIP Parameter File Plan/Channel Analysis Example 
0 

The first example presented here consists ofrunning the operl file against the terrestrial MDB. The TSIP parameter 
file used to perform this run is reproduced in table 4.3.2.A. 

The parameters selected for this particular run were: 

PDF Type: TS 
PDF Name: aper! 
Env File Type: MDB_TS 
Env file Name: 
TSORB Cale? N 

(Terrestrial file). 

(Name ofthe file submitted to analysis). 

(Terrestrial MDB. If the correct spelling ofthis command is not 

known, the user can enter any command, NNN for example, and a 

help message will be displayed at the bottom of the screen). 

Not required, since the operl file is being analyzed against the whole 

MDB. 

(Orbit intersection analysis was not requested).

TSIP Run Name: 001 (Any five character name can be entered here. This 
name is appended to the TSIP Ingres tables names. 
If the user wants to re-run a parameter file, 
changing the margin for example, the TSIP tables 
would be over-written unless this name is 
changed). 

Report Type: y ("Y", which is the default, was left unchanged. 
Therefore, TSIP will produce the 5 interference 
analysis reports). 

After the TSIP Parameter File has been completed the user will "ADD" (number 3 on the number pad) this file to 
the list ofparameter files (assuming it is a new parameter file; otherwise would be number 4, "Update"). 

This command will be followed by PF3, which will get the user back to the TSIP parameter files screen. An 
example ofthis screen is presented in Table 4.3.2.B. The name of the TSIP parameter file in this example is operl 
(note that the same name as the pdfname can be used). 

On this screen the user can submit the TSIP study, either in Batch (number 2 in the number pad) or interactive, 
"GO" (number I in the number pad). To submit the file the user has to select it (the Tab key is used to move from 
one area of the screen to another. The arrow keys are used to move down or up the parameter files list). To select 
the file, the cursor has to be moved down to the operl name and Oentered in the number pad. Now, if the user 
wants to submit the job interactively ("GO"), a message will be shown on the screen, asking the user if he/she is 
sure of running this job interactive. This is done because a TSIP run could lock the user's terminal for a long time. 
No destination file name is needed for interactive jobs. Ifno destination file name is entered, the report will be 
written to the screen, otherwise it will go to the file name entered ( on the user's default directory). 

Summer1995 4.3-4 TSIP Reference Manual 


In Batch mode the user has to enter a destination file name, "tt" in this example. TSIP will use this file name as part 
of the reports. In this example, the report names will be: 

tt _ oper 1 _00 l.NNN 

where NNN stands for the extension of each one of the 5 reports. Remember that 001 was the TSIP run name 
selected on the parameter screen. 

After submitting the job, the user will get a message indicating that the TSIP tables will be destroyed in one week 
(this was decided by the members, since accumulation of TSIP report tables uses the disk space fairly quickly). At 
this point the user has to depress the "Enter" key and the TSIP analysis will start.

The "Interference Tables" are Ingres tables produced by TSIP. These tables contain the results ofthe TSIP run and 

will be automatically destroyed after one week. 

The TSIP "Report files" are the actual reports (text files) which are written to the user's default directory. These 
files will stay on that directory until destroyed by the user. 

Note that the name of the tables and report files are constructed by TSIP using the destination file name, the 
parameter file name and the TSIP Run Name. 

The "Number of Station Groups Passed at Analysis" is the total number ofmicrowave radio hop pairs ( one from the 
operl file and one from the TS MDB) which meet the culling criteria, i.e. within the 200 km coordination distance 
and in the same or adjacent frequency band in the example. 

The "Number of Interference Cases Reported" is the total number of analyzed station pairs which do not meet the 
interference criteria, i.e. requirement plus the S(dB) margin used in this example. 

The time and date ofthe TSIP run are given at the bottom ofthe report. 

4.3.2.2 TS-TS TSIP Study fu:port Example <P/C) 
The Study Report generated by TSIP in this example is reproduced on Table 4.3.2.2. 

This report is a summary of the interference analysis job, which combines input data, taken from the TSIP 
parameter file, output data, taken from the execution report, and computer system statistics.

The fields in the report are: 

Project Number: FRSEO The program will use the default project number, unless the user 
changes it. The user might change it if he/she is working on a 
special project, or doing consulting work, for example. If this is 
the case, the accounting information will be stored under the 
project number entered by the user.

4.3.2.3 TS-TS ISIP Stations Passed to Analysis Report Example CP/Cl 
The stations passed to analysis report generated by TSIP is reproduced on Table 4.3.2.3. 

This report lists all the stations from the pdf submitted to analysis and all the stations from the environment 
(selected by the user) which were passed to analysis by TSIP. 

The stations from the pdfsubmitted to analysis appear on the left hand side ofthe report and the stations from the 
environment appear on the right hand side. 

The call sign, station name, operator code, latitude, longitude and ground elevation (ams!), in this order, are given 
for each stations. The stations are listed in call sign order. 

TSIP Reference Manual 4.3-9 Summer1995 


It can be found that stations which are listed in this report do not appear in the detailed report of interference cases. 

This simply means that these stations were analyzed and the interference levels were found acceptable by TSIP. 

In this particular example the proposed pdfhas 2 stations and 37 were selected by TSIP from the environment. 
Therefore, there would be a maximum of74 two-way (transmit and receive) possible combinations between these 2 
columns, that is 148 combinations maximum. The report presented on table 4.3.2.1 indicates, however, that 206 
station groups were passed to analysis. The explanation to this is that some stations have links with other stations 
which are outside the coordination zone ofthe study. These links are still analyzed by TSIP, thus some stations on 
the list are passed to analysis more than once. For example, the station CFW203, Greenstone, has links with 
CFW303, Mt. Lolo, and CFW277, Jim Mtn. Mt. Lolo is on the list, but Jim Mtn. is not, since it's outside the 100 
km radio coordination circle selected for this study. But TSIP will analyze: 

(Site A, Site B) Vs. (Greenstone, Mt. Lolo) 

(Site A, Site B) Vs. (Greenstone, Jim Mtn.) 

and this will be counted by TSIP as 2 groups ofstations passed to analysis (Greenstone is counted twice in this 
example). 

It should be pointed out that, in this example, interference from and into Jim Mtn. will not be analyzed. But 
interference from and into Greenstone facing Jim Mtn. will be analyzed.

less than 90 (km), TSIP will assume free space 
propagation conditions in this case. 

Total antenna discrimination in dB. As indicated before 
this is an HCPol into HCPol case. Therefore, the 
discrimination will be 43.0 + 28.3 =71.3 dB. 

EIRP Advantage, in dB. Relative interfering and victim 
signal EIRP's. In this example the EIRP ofthe interfering 
transmit signal is 9.8 dB higher than the victim's remote 
transmitter EIRP. 

Distance advantage, in dB. Is equal to 20 log of the ratio 
ofthe interfering path length to the victim path length: 20 
log (42.83/20.45) =6.4. 

Calculated Co-polar C/1 or interference level, in dB or 
dBm respectively. In this case the value calculated· is a 
C/1 value. TSIP will calculate a C/1 or -I value depending 
on the CTI{ used for the case. 

Calculated cross-polar C/1 or -I value, in dB or dBm 
respectively. In this case the value calculated is a C/1 
value. Since this is an H into H case (co-polar) the C/1 
CoPol value will be used. The brackets indicate that this 
value, the XPol in this example, is not being use. Is just 
reported as a reference for the designer. 

Required C/1 in dB. This value is obtained by TSIP from 
the CTI{ subsidiary table. TSIP enters the table using the 
traffic codes and equipment keys, and the frequency 
separation and returns the required C/1; linear 
interpolation is used in the table. 

The calculated margin is equal to the calculated C/1 minus 
the required C/1. In this example the required C/1 is 
greater than the calculated C/1; this is then an interference 

case.

This command will be followed by PF3 which will get the user back to the TSIP parameter files screen. An 
example of this screen is presented in Table 4.3.3B. The name of the TSIP parameter file in this example is aper! 
(note that the same name as the pdfname can be used). 

On this screen the user can submit the TSIP study, either in Batch (number 2 in the number pad) or interactive, 
"GO" (number I on the number pad). To submit the file the user has to select it (the Tab key is used to move from 
one area of the screen to another. The arrow keys are used to move down or up the parameter files list). To select 
the file, the cursor has to be moved down to the aper! name and O entered in the nubmer pad. Now, if the user 
wants to submit the job interactively ("GO"), a message will be shown on the screen, asking the user if he/she is 
sure of running this job interactive. This is done because a TSIP run could lock the user's terminal for a long time. 
No destination file name is needed for interactive jobs. If no destination file name is entered, the report will be 
written to the screen, otherwise it will go to the file name entered (on the user's default directory).

The "Interference Tables" are Ingres tables produced by TSIP. These tables contain the results of the TSIP run and 
will be automatically destroyed after one week. 

The TSIP "Report files" are the actual reports (text files) which are written to the user's default directory. These 
files will stay on that directory until destroyed by the user. 

Note that the name of the tables and report files are constructed by TSIP using the destination file name, the 
parameter file name and the TSIP Run Name. 

The "Number of Station Groups Passed at Analysis" is the total number of microwave radio hop pairs ( one from the 
aper! file and one from the TS MDB) which meet the culling criteria, i.e. within the I 00 km coordination distance 
and in the same or adjacent frequency band in the example. Note that in the P/C analysis this number was 206, and 
it is 208 in this case. This only reflects changes made to the MDB in between the two analysis.

102 in this case, as compared to only I in P/C analysis. This indicates that Band is indeed a "worst case" analysis. 

The time and date ofthe TSIP run are given at the bottom ofthe report.

4.3.3.3 TS-TS ISIP Stations Passed to Analysis Report Example CBand) 
The stations passed to analysis report generated by TSIP is reproduced on Table 4.3.3.3. 
This report lists all the stations from the pdf submitted to analysis and all the stations from the environment 
(selected by the user) which were passed to analysis by TSIP. 

The stations from the pdf submitted to analysis appear on the left hand side of the report and the stations from the 
environment appear on the right hand side. 
The call sign, station name, operator code, latitude, longitude and ground elevation (ams!), in this order, are given 

for each station. The stations are listed in call sign order. 
It can be found that stations which are listed in this report do not appear in the detailed report of interference cases. 
This simply means that these stations were analyzed and the interference levels were found acceptable by TSIP.

The following group offields for the report summarizes the particular geometry ofthe 
interfering and victim hops, i.e. distances and discrimination angles.) · 

In TSIP a case number is assigned to each Interfering/Victim 
pair of stations. The case could be divided into sub-cases. For 
example there would be 2 different sub-cases if the interference 
into the main and into the diversity antenna ofthe victim station 
exceeds the requirements, 

This indicates that the interfering transmitter belongs to the 
proposed pdfand the victim receiver to the environment. 

This is the environment selected by the user in the TSIP 
Parameter File. 

Band analysis was selected by the user in the TSIP parameter 
File. 

0.0 (dB) margin was used in this particular example. 
This coordination distance was entered in the TSIP Parameter

AUse: TR This is the antenna use code. Transmit/Receive in this 

case. 

Gain: 44.0 dB This is the (transmit) interfering antenna gain, in dB. It is 
read by TSIP from the subsidiary database. 

TS Ant. Code: UHXI0-65EL This is the antenna code for the (transmit) interfering 
antenna. 

X Ref. Ant: UHXI0-65ER This is the cross-reference antenna code (of the TS ant. 
Code). In this case this is a non-symmetrical antenna 
pattern, and the UHZ I 0-65EL AND UHX I 0-65ER are the 
left and right paterns, respectively, of the same antenna 
mode (UHXI0-65EL). 

Model: UHXI0-65E Interfering (transmit) antenna model. 

Discr. HCPol: 43.0 dB CoPolar H-H discrimination of the (transmit) interfering 
antenna. This is obtained by TSIP from the subsidiary 
antenna data table. TSIP enters this table using the antenna 
code and searching for the discrimination value 
corresponding to the discrimination angle (24.3 degrees in 
this case). TSIP will interpolate linearly if an exact match 
for the angle is not found in the table. 

Discr. V CPol: 46.0dB Sarne as above, but for V-V discrimination.

(This block ofrecords includes all the information pertaining to the victim receive antenna). 

Antenna#: 11 This is the (receive) victim antenna number recorded on 
the pdf or on the MOB antenna table. 

AUse: RX Antenna use code. Receive only in this example. 

Gain: 36.3 dB This is the (receive) victim antenna gain, in dB. It is read 
by TSIP from the subsidiary database. 

RX Ant. Code: PL4-65C This is the antenna code of the (receive) victim antenna. 

X Ref. Ant: P4-65C This is the cross-reference antenna code. The PL4-65C 
antenna does not have a pattern coded in the SOB. TSIP 
then uses the cross-reference (P4-65C) antenna pattern. 

Model: No antenna model is printed in this case, since the PL4-5C 
and the P4-65C are difference antenna models.

Channel status code ofvictim receiver. 

Since the TX and RX frequencies are equal to the Band 
center frequency, the frequency separation is always 0 
MHz in Band Analysis. 

Interfering transmitter output power, in dBm. This record 
is taken from the pdf or MDB channel table. Not used in 
Band Analysis. TSIP uses a default value of40 dBm. 

Interfering tramsitter antenna feeder system loss, in dB 
(from tranmitter output flange to antenna flange). 

Victim receiver antenna feeder system loss, in dB (from 
antenna flange to receiver input flange). 

Receive signal power at the input of the victim receiver, in 
dBm. Note that this is the desired signal level. 

This is the path loss, in dB, from the interfering transmitter 
to the victim receiver. Since the distance is less than 90 
(km), TSIP will assume free space propagation conditions 
in this case. 

Total antenna discrimination in dB. As indicated before 
this is an HCPol into HCPol case. Therefore, the 
discriministion will be 43.0 + 28.3 =71.3 dB. 

EIRP Advantage, in dB. Relative interfering and victim 
signal EIRP' s. In this example the EIRP of the interfering 
transmit signal is 18.8 dB higher than the victim's remote 
transitter EIRP. Note that the EIRP Adv. is 9 dB more than 
the P/C case. This is because TSIP is running the default 
power of40 dBm instead ofthe channel power of31 dBm. 

Distance advantage, in dB. Is equal to 20 log of the ratio 
of the interfering path length to the victim path length: 20 
log (42.83/20.45) =6.4. 

Calculated Co-polar C/1 in dB. 

Calcualted cross-polar C/1 or -I value, in dB or dBm 
respectively. Not used in Band Analysis. 

In Band Analysis TSJP uses a fixed requirement at 110 dB. 

The calculated margin is equal to the calculated C/1 minus 
the required C/1. In this example, the required C/1 is 
greater than the calculated C/1: this is then an interference 

case.

TSIP REPORTS 

4.2.0 General 
After submission of the TSIP command procedure, the TSIP reports will be generated automatically by the program. 
The number and type of reports generated will depend on the analysis itself (TS-TS or TS-Es or satellite orbit 
intersection) and on the selection made by the user in the parameter file. All TSIP reports are defaulted to "Y", that 
means they will be created unless the user changes the option to "N''. In general, TSIP will produce execution and 
calculation results reports. 

In some cases TSIP produces blank calculation results reports (e.g. when there are no interference cases). In those 
cases the user should look at the execution report, which may indicate the cause. Otherwise the pdf and parameter 
file have to be inspected. 

4.2.1 TS-TS Interference Calculation Reports 
There are five TS-TS interference reports which the user can select individually. The default for these reports ( on 
the TSIP parameter file screen) is "Y''. Thus, TSIP will generate the 5 reports unless the user changes one or more 
ofthem to "N''. 

The orbit Intersection report will also be generated if orbit intersection analysis is requested by the user (this report 
is independent from the 5 interference analysis report, but can be requested along with them in the same TSIP run). 

) 

The 5 interference analysis reports are: 

-Execution Report 
Study Report, 
Station Summary Report, 
Case Detail Report, and 
Case Summary Report. 

The TSIP Execution Report presents to the user a summary of the TSIP run itself. This summary includes the 
names of all files and tables involved in the analysis, the number of stations passed to analysis and reported 
interference cases, and the time and date of the analysis. 

The TSIP Study Report includes the same information as the Execution Report, with the exception of the report 
names, but also includes a table of all the selections made by the user on the TSIP parameter file. 

The Station Summary Report is a listing , presented in 2 columns, of all the stations in the file submitted to analysis 
and the environment stations passed to analysis. 

The Case Detail Report is the detailed interference analysis report. 

The Case summary Report contains summary information ( one line per case) of all the cases reported in the Case 
Detail Report.

BASIC STEPS TO PERFORM A MJCS INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS 

4.1.1 Po:paration of a ISIP input file 
To test a new microwave radio facility, the user will have to prepare a complete pdf of that facility (instructions 
concerning the preparation and editing of a pdf are contained in the MICS User Guide). If the user, however, is 
modifying or adding to an existing microwave facility, a pdf from the existing data can be prepared and that pdf 
edited, incorporating the appropriate changes. The records of the existing microwave facility can be part of the 
MICS database, or could be an existing pdf, in the user's directory or other users coordination directories, or in the 
public directory. In any event, the user can produce a pdf, either from the MDB or other tables, and make all the 
required editorial changes to that pdf. 

4.1.2 Validation ofa pdf 
After completion of the pdf, the user has to validate it before using it on input to TSIP. This is done by running the 
pdfthrough program VALIDATE. 

Program VALIDA TE frrst validates the pdf. This validation process consists of checking that the various fields of 
the pdf are within pre-established ranges. There are some fields, however, which are not checked, either because 
they are user's optional fields, or they do not affect the integrity of the database, or the TSJP results. It should be 
also pointed out that this validation process does not guarantee a successful TSIP run. Since, erroneous input values 
for a given microwave station will be accepted by VALIDA TE provided they are within the pre-established 
acceptable ranges (e.g. errors in the geographical coordinates ofa site, if they are within the latitude and longitude 
limits accepted by VALIDA TE). 

4.1.3 Preparation ofaISIP Parameter file 
The TSIP Parameter File consists of a set of instructions which will control the TSJP run. This set of instructions 
contains those which are selected by the user. 

The TSIP command procedure is created on screen (see section. 4.3.2). This program will prompt the user for input 
data -e.g. name of test file, interference environment, margin, etc. -and with this data it will create a command 
procedure. (More details about the TSIP Parameter file are given in the example presented later in this section). 

Once the parameter file has been completed, the user can submit it either in batch or interactive modes (see example 
later in this section),

ISIP Operation and Reports 

4.0 INTRODUCTION 
The main program used for performing interference analysis in MICS is the Terrestrial and Space interference 
Program (TSIP). To operate TSIP the following basic steps have to be followed: 

preparation ofan input file, Primary Datafile (pelf) in MICS; 
validation ofthe pdf; 
preparation and submission ofa TSIP parameter file. 

After the TSIP parameter file has been submitted, TSIP will automatically make the interference analysis and 
generate the execution and calculation reports. The type of reports generated depends on whether the analysis is 
terrestrial station-terrestrial station (TS-TS) or terrestrial station-earth station (TS-ES). These reports will be 
discussed later in this section.

ANALYSIS OF THE PROBABILITY OF INTERSECTING THE GEOSTATIONARY 
SATELLITE ORBIT 

3.0 Inroduction 
The users can execute an orbit intersection analysis along with the interference analysis by entering "y" at the 
"TSO RB Cale." field of the TSIP parameter file. The ORBIT program can also be executed from the auxiliary 
program menu. 

3.5.1 Definition ofthe Problem 
In accordance with the provisions ofthe ITU Radio Regulations, the main beam axis of the antenna of a terrestrial 
station employing an e.i.r.p. equal to +55 dBW, should be away from the GSO by at least 2 degrees. For smaller 
angular separations the TS transmit power should be reduced in accordance with the regulations. The GSO 
intersection problem consists, then, on determining whether the main beam axis of the TS antenna points within 2 
degrees from the GSO. 

The ITU Radio Regulations also indicate that the effect of refraction, onto the TS antenna beam, shall be 
considered in the angular separation calculations. Since the atmospheric refractive index changes with local 
meteorological conditions, TSIP calculates the angular separation for two extreme values of the refractive index: 
250 and 400. These values of the refractive index are practically never exceeded. Therefore, the "minimum" and 
"maximum" refraction calculated by TSIP are the extreme values for all practical purposes. TSIP predicts then the 
probability of intersecting the GSO for the two extreme values, 250 and 400, ofthe atmospheric refractive index. 

) 

3.5.2 The Geostationary Satellite Orbit and the Effects Atmospheric Refraction 
The geostationary satellite orbit (GSO) is a circle of approximately 42230 km radius, coplanar and concentric with 
the equatorial circle (the equatorial circle radius is approximately 6375 km). For an observer facing towards the 
equator, the GSO will appear as an arc rising from the East and West and Culminating at a longitude equal to that 
ofthe observer. 

If no atmospheric refraction effects are taken into consideration, the elevation angle and the azimuth of a vector 
joining a point on the surface ofthe Earth to a point on the GSO, are related by the following equation: 

A= arc cos [tan (lat)/(tan(arc cos(E/k)-E))] degrees 

Where: 

A= 180 -Az (degrees) 

Az = azimuth of the vector joining the point on the surface of the Earth to the 
point on the GSO; in degrees measured from North. 

lat= latitude ofthe point on the surface ofthe Earth, in degrees. 

E = elevation angle of the vector joining the point on the surface of the Earth to 
the point on the GSO, in degrees measured with respect to the local 
horizo~tal. 

k = ratio between the GSO radius and the radius of the equatorial circle (k is 
approximately equal to 6.62). 

TSIP Reference Manual 3.5 -1 Fall 1996 


For a given latitude and elevation angle, there are two solutions for the equation given above. In practical terms 
the point on the surface ofthe Earth will correspond to the location of the terrestrial station (TS), and the elevation 
angle under study will be the elevation angle of the TS antenna main beam axis. Therefore, for a given elevation 

angle of the TS antenna main beam axis, there will be two possible intersection points on the GSO, one East and 
one West ofthe TS. 

Now, the actual azimuth ofthe TS antenna main beam axis will indicate whether intersection between the TS main 
beam and the GSO is really possible. 

The usual effect of atmospheric refraction is to bend the radiowave rays towards the Earth. Therefore, the main 
beam of a TS antenna, having an initial elevation angle Ei will leave the Earth atmosphere with an angle Ef: 
Ef= Ei -T (degrees) 
Where: 

Ef= elevation ofthe TS antenna main beam axis corrected by 
refraction; measured in degrees with respect to the local 
horizontal. 

Ei = initial elevation angle of the TS antenna main beam axis; 
measured in degrees with respect to the local horizontal. 

T = absolute value ofthe correction due to atmospheric 
refraction, in degrees. 

The extent ofbending (value ofT) depends on the climate of the region where the TS is situated, on the altitude of 

o 

the TS and on the TS antenna main beam · initial elevation angle. The refraction correction angle. (T) is, 
unfortunately, a non-linear function of the initial elevation angle of the TS beam (Ei). Therefore, approximate 
numerical methods have to be used for calculating the refraction-corrected elevation angle (Ef). 

The effect of refraction can now be taken into consideration by re-writing the equation relating the azimuth and 
the elevation angle, using the refraction-corrected elevation angle instead ofthe initial elevation angle: 
Af= arc cos [tan (lat)/(tan (arc cos (Ef/K) -Ef))] 
Where: 
Af= 180 -Azf 

Azf= azimuth of the vector joining the point on the surface of the Earth to the point on the GSO, taking into 
account the effect of refraction. Measured in degrees from North. 

lat= latitude ofthe point on the surface of the Earth. 

Ef= elevation angle ofthe vector joining the point on the surface of the Earth to the point on the GSO, corrected 
for refraction. Measured in degrees with respect to the local horizontal. 

K = ratio between GSO radius and Earth radius.

ORBIT is the MICS program used to detennine the probability of intersecting the GSO. The program calculates 
and reports the following: 
critical azimuth zone 
crtical longitude zone 
longitude ofthe intercept 
minimum angular separation 

The definition and method of calculation of each one of these parameters will be discussed in the following 
paragraphs. 

3.5.3.1 The Refracted Orbit Trace 
The effect of atmospheric refraction is taken into consideration in ORBIT by introducing the concept of the 
"Refracted Orbit Trace." The refracted orbit trace is generated by "elevating" the "geometric orbit trace" (i.e. the 
geostationary satellite orbit) to its refracted position. The word elevating is used since a ray is normally bent 
downwards by the atmosphere. Therefore, to intersect the orbit a ray has to be launched at a higher angle with ) respect to the angle that would be required without refraction. Thus, the apparent position of the refracted orbit is 
above the geometric orbit, or "elevated" with respect to the geometric orbit trace. A refracted orbit trace is 

generated for each one ofthe refractive index limits used in TSIP, 250 and 400 respectively. 
For a given TS location, the refracted orbit trace can be expressed as a mathematical relation between the 
elevation and azimuth from the TS to the orbit, with the elevation angle as the explicit variable. 

The geometric orbit trace is given by the relation: 
Ei = arc tan [k/tan (B/2)] -(B/2) 

Where: 
Ei = elevation angle of the vector joining the TS station and a 
point on the GSO. Measured in degrees with respect to the 

local horizontal. 
B = arc tan [tan (lat)/cos A] 
lat = latitude ofthe TS 
A= 180-Az 
Az = azimuth ofthe vector joining the TS station and a point on 

theGSO. 
k= (R-Ro-H)/(R +Ro+ H) 
R = GSO radius, in km 

TSIP Reference Manual 3.5-3 Summer1995 


Ro = Earth radius, in km 

H = site altitude, in km 

The refracted orbit trace is given by the relation: 

ER=Ei+T 

Where: 

ER = elevation angle ofthe vector joining the TS and a point on 
the refracted orbit trace. Measured in degrees with 
respect to the local horizontal. 

T = refraction correction corresponding to the elevation angle 
Ei, in degrees. 

The relation between the elevation angle and the refraction correction is non-linear. ORBIT uses a set of 
approximate exponential equations for calculating T. Ifthe calculation of T and ER is repeated for several values 
of the azimuth, a graph could be plotted, and that would be the refracted orbit trace.It should be pointed out that, 
since the refraction correction is non-linear, the refracted trace is not a circle anymore. More information about 
the calculation of the refracted orbit trace can be found on the MICS "Microwave Frequency Coordination 
Engineering Considerations". 

Since the effect ofrefraction is taken into consideration by generating the refracted orbit trace, ORBIT considers 
that the radiowave coming from the TS antenna follows a straight line path. All subsequent angular separation 
calculations are made between the unrefracted TS antenna main beam axis and the refracted orbit trace. 

3.5.3.2 Critical Azimuth Zone 
Ifthe refracted orbit trace is plotted as a graph of elevation angle Vs. azimuth and a horizontal line, corresponding 
to the elevation angle of the TS antenna main beam axis, were traced in that graph, this line may intersect the 
refracted orbit trace in two points (if the TS beam elevation is too low, the beam may be blocked by the Earth. If 
it is too high, the beam may be above the entire orbit). Ifthe line intersects the refracted orbit, the azimuth of the 
intersection point closer to the actual azimuth ofthe TS, is the critical azimuth for that particular elevation angle. 
Now, ORBIT defines a "Critical Azimuth Zone". To define this zone, the TS beam is assumed to move (in 
azimuth) along the horizontal line until the minimum angular separation with respect to the refracted orbit trace is 
2 degrees. (The minimum angular separation is measured, in general, along the normal to the refracted orbit trace. 
If the intersection of the normal with the refracted orbit is, however, below the radio horizon, the minimum 
separation is measured to the point of intersection between the refracted orbit and the radio horizon). 

The beam is assumed to move East and West of the critical azimuth and the 2 degrees separation points will define 
the East and West limits of the critical azimuth zone respectively. Now, if the actual azimuth of the TS antenna 
main beam axis is comprised within the critical azimuth zone, the TS antenna main beam is defmed to intersect the 
orbit.

3.5.3.3 Longitude ofthe Orbit Intercept and Critical Longitude Zone 
The azimuth of a vector joining the TS and a point on the GSO, and the longitude of the point on the GSO, are 
related by the following equation: 

DL = arc tan [sin (lat) tan SJ 

Where: 

DL = difference between the longitude ofthe TS and the 
longitude of the orbit intercept, in degrees. 
lat= latitude of the TS, in degrees. 

S = 180 -Az 

Az = azimuth ofthe vector joining the TS and the point on the 
GSO. 

Therefore, since the azimuth of the terrestrial antenna main beam axis is known, and the latitude and longitude of 
the TS are also known, the longitude of the orbit intercept can be calculated from the equation. Now, the critical 
azimuth points (defined in the previous paragraph) will define an East and a West critical longitudes, which are 
the limits of the critical longitude zone. (The East and West longitude limits are calculated using the same 
equation relating the longitude and azimuth given above). 

The longitude of the orbit intercept, as well as the East and West limits of the critical longitude zone, are 

calculated and reported by ORBIT. 

) 

3.5.3.4 Minimum Angular Separation 
ORBIT calculates the minimum angular separation between the unrefracted TS antenna main beam axis vector 
and the refracted orbit trace. In the elevation angle Vs. azimuth graph, the minimum angular separation is the .. 
length of the normal from the point representing the TS antenna main beam axis to the refracted orbit trace. Ifthis 
perpendicular, however, intersects the refracted orbit trace below the horizon, TSORB assumes that the minimum 
separation is the distance between the point representing the TS main beam axis and the intersection between the 
radio horizon (horizontal line in the graph) and the refracted orbit trace. 

ORBIT calculates the minimum angular separation to both refracted orbit traces, corresponding to the refractive 
index of 250 and 400 respectively. The minimum of the two values is reported by ORBIT. Ifthe TS antenna 
main beam axis is, however, included between the two refracted orbits, ORBIT reports an angular separation of 
zero degrees. If the minimum angular separation is greater than 5 degrees, ORBIT does not report the exact value 
of the angular separation, a message is printed, indicating that the separation is greater than 5 degrees. 

The method used in ORBIT for calculating the minimum angular separation depends on whether the TS antenna 
main beam axis points above, "North" using the ORBIT terminology, of the refracted orbit trace for N = 400, or 
points below, "South", of the refracted orbit trace for N = 250. In the first case ORBIT calculates the angle 
between the TS antenna main beam axis vector and the vector joining the TS and the point of intersection between 
the radio horizon and the refracted orbit trace for N = 400. In the second case an itenative procedure is used. 
Starting from the TS main beam axis azimuth, an increment to the azimuth is given and the point in the refracted 
orbit trace (N = 250) corresponding to this second azimuth is calculated. The angular separation between the TS 
main beam axis and the point on the orbit trace is then calculated. The procedure is repeated for different values 
of the azimuth increment, until the minimum value of the angular separation is found (the calculation is made 
using the secant method of iteration).

3.5.3.5 Maximum Transmit Power 
0

The maximum transmit power of a terrestrial microwave radio station that points at or near the GSO, shall be 

limited in accordance with CCIR recommendation (i.e. Rec. 406). The maximum transmit power is a function of 
the angular separation and the frequency of operation. The limits used in ORBIT are the following: 

for a TS station operating in the frequency bands between 1 and 1OGHZ the TS maximum EJRP 
cannot exceed 55 dBW; 

for a TS antenna beam pointing within 0.5 degrees of the GSO, the maximum EIRP shall not exceed 
47dBW; 

for a TS beam pointing between 0.5 and 1.5 degrees of the GSO, the maximum allowable EIRP will 
increase linearly from 47 to 55 dBW. 

For a TS operating in the bands between 10 and 15 GHz: 
the maximum EIRP is 55 dBW is the angular separation to the GSO is more than 1.5 
degrees; 

if the angular separation is less then 1.5 degrees, the maximum EIRP is 45 dBW. 
For a TS station operating in the frequency bands above 15 GHz the maximum allowable EIRP is 55 
dBW, regardless of the direction of maximum radiation.

TERRESTRIAL STATION -EARTH STATION (TS-ES) INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS 

3.4.0 Introduction 
The function of TSIP in the TS-ES mode is to analyze interference between earth stations, on one hand, and 
terrestrial radio relay stations on the other, and to report the results if the calculated interference levels do not meet 
preset criteria. 

Since the analysis is performed between ES and TS stations, an ES PDF cannot be analyzed against the ES database. 
Also, ES-ES pairs of stations will riot be passed to analysis, even if they meet all other selection criteria (i.e. are 
within the coordination area, operate in the same or adjacent bands and meet the operator code or call sign 
restrictions imposed by the user). 

3.4.1 Frequency-Sensitive Interference Analysis Options in TS-ES 
There are two frequency-sensitive interference analysis options in TS-ES. The options are "Band", and " Channel" 
Analysis. 

Band Analysis 

The stations are assumed to work on any frequency in their respective frequency bands. The calculated I or C/1 
values are compared with a fixed requirement. 

Channel Analysis 

Even if the option selected by the user is Channel, Band analysis is always performed first. Only those pairs of 
stations which do not meet the band analysis interference criteria are passed to channel analysis. 

In Channel analysis the stations are assumed to be using the frequencies, traffic types and equipments defined in 
their respective channel records. Calculated I or C/1 values are compared with requirements obtained from the 
CTX's tables. 

3.4.2 TS-ES TSIP Parameter File 
Once the pdf that is to be analyzed has been prepared, and validated, (see the VALIDA TE section in the User 
Guide) the user has to decide on the mode of interference analysis which is required and establish the set of 
commands that will control it, i.e. create the parameter file. Note that in this case the Pdf can be ES or TS. 

There are several commands, selected by the user, that control a TS-ES run. A discussion of them is included here, 
more operational details are given in the TSIP section of the MICS User Guide. 

The commands that control a TSIP run are selected by the user on screen 3.1.A "TSIP Parameters". This screen is 
reproduced in Figure 3.4.01.

Env File Type: 

This field will indicate to TSIP whether the user is submitting for analysis a 
Terrestrial (T) or Earth station (E) file. 

In this field the user enters the name of the file being submitted for analysis. This 
name shall match exactly the pdf name on Screen 1.1 "TS PDF Maintenance or 
Screen 1.2, "ES PDF Maintenance". Also, the file has to be valid for TSIP; i.e. the 
VALIDATE status code (right column on screen 1.1 or 1.2) has to be "U", "T" or 
"S". Ifthis is not the case TSIP will report an error condition. 

In this field the user selects the environment type to run his/her file against. The 
options are: INTRA, PDF_ES or PDF_TS, and MDB_ES or MDB_TS. The 
option INTRA is not applicable to TS-ES analysis. Also, if the pdf submitted to 
analysis is an ES pdf, the option MDB_ES is not valid. Ifthe user wants to analyze 
an ES pdf against the whole terrestrial database (restricted of course to the 
coordination area, frequency band and other culling parameters), he/she will select 
MDB _ TS. Ifthe file is going to be analyzed against another TS file in the user's 
directory, the parameter to select is PDF_TS. Ifthe pdf is a TS file, the user can 
analyze it against the whole MDB _ ES or against an ES file in his/her own 
directory.

TSIP (i.e. status U, Tor S). 

This option is valid only if the pdf submitted to analysis is a TS file (see TSIP TSTS). 


In TS-ES analysis there are two options to calculate the propagation loss between 
the terrestrial and earth stations. The TSIP default method, based on the CCIR 
SJM 1971 report, and the "Spherical Earth" method, based on CCIR Report 715-1. 
TSIP will automatically default to the first method, number "l" on the Propagation 
loss field. The user can change it to "Spherical Earth" by typing "2" on the 
Propagation Loss Field. 

In this field the user selects the maximum frequency separation (between 
interfering and victim carrier frequencies) to be used in the TSIP analysis. TSIP 
will use the figure entered by the user if the distance between the interfering and 
victim stations is greater than one half of the selected coordination distance. Ifthe 
distance between the interfering and victim stations is equal or less then one half of 
the selected coordination distance, TSIP will default to the greater of: 

the value entered by the user and 300 MHz, ifthe interfering and victim traffic 

codes are not PCS codes; 

the value entered by the user and 150 MHz, if the interferer and/or victim 
traffic is a PCS code. 

In TS-ES analysis the coordination distance is part of the ES antenna record and it 
is not selected on the TSIP parameter screen. 

This parameter is used to sensitize the interference analysis in terms of maximum 
acceptable interference level, or minimum acceptable carrier to interference ratio; 
default value is 0( dB). The maximum acceptable carrier to interference ratio (C/1) 
as a function of frequency separation are stored in the MICS subsidiary (sd _ctx and 
sd_ctxd) tables, called "CTX" tables. Ifthe user does not enter any values in tliis 
Required Margin field, TSIP will use the default value (0dB). This means that 
TSIP will report all those cases which do not meet the CTX requirement for this 
particular frequency separation. If the user enters •.positive valued, TSIP will use 
this value as a "safety margin", and will report all those cases which do not meet 
the CTX requirement plus the margin. Although negative margin values can be 
entered, they should not be used in general; they are useful only for special cases of 
post-analysis or for testing the program. 
For a general discussion of interference requirements see section 3.4..8, 3.4.9, and 
3.4.11. 

The user can select one of two available options: BAND or CHAN, which stands 
for CHANNEL (see paragraphs 3.1.1 and 3.1.2).

Ifthe user enters OPERA TOR CODE, the cursor will go to the OPER. CODES 
table. 

The user will enter in this table all the environment call signs he/she has selected 
for this interference analysis. This option is used, in general, when the user knows 
of a site, or sites, which are potential interference cases with the file under study. 
TSIP will look, in this case, only to those environment sites selected by the user; it 
will be a limited but faster analysis. The user can introduce changes to his/her 
proposed file and repeat the analysis against the selected environment call signs, 
which will allow the user to observe the effect produced by the changes to the pdf. 

The user will enter in this table all the environment operator codes he/she has 
selected for this analysis. This could be just his/her own company code, for 
example. In this case TSIP would look only to those stations in the environment 
that belong to the user (this would be a TSJP analysis in Protect mode, since it is 
only looking at the user's stations). Or the user could select the operator code(s) of 
companies he/she is doing the analysis on behalf of.

TSIP Run Name· This is a suffix added by TSIP to the TSIP tables root name. Note that TSIP writes 
the analysis to Ingres tables. If a TSIP study is repeated and the root name of the 
study (i.e. name of the parameter file) or the TSIP Run Name are not changed, the 
tables of the first study will be overwritten. Then if the user wants to repeat an 
interference analysis (e.g. after changing name ofthe proposed pdfparameters) and 
wants to preserve the results of the first analysis, the TSIP Run Name should be 
changed. 

3.4.3 Coordination Distances in TS-ES 
In TS-ES analysis the coordination distance is not selected in the TSIP parameter file. This is because the 
coordination distances for earth stations are part of the earth station's antenna record. In fact, four coordination 
distances are defined for earth station: the tropospheric (CCIR propagation Mode I) coordination distance and the 
precipitation scatter (CCIR propagation Mode 2) coordination distance, for the transmit and receive directions 
respectively. 

The coordination area, for CCIR propagation Mode 1, is defined in TS-ES as a circle of radius equal to the 
coordination distance and (Tx or Rx) centered on the earth station. Now, any terrestrial station located within this 
coordination area will be passed to analysis by TSIP, provided it works in the same or adjacent frequency bands and 
meets any other culling commands selected by the user. 

In a similar manner, the coordination area for CCIR propagation Mode 2 is a circle ofradius equal to the Mode 2 

) coordination distance (Tx or Rx) and centered on the earth station. TSIP will pass to analysis any stations located 
within the precipitation scatter coordination area, provided it works in the same or adjacent frequency bands and 
meets any other culling commands selected by the user. 

3.4.4 Propagation Loss Calculations in TS-ES 
3.4.4.1 Propagation Mechanisms 
There are two significantly different mechanisms by which an interfering emission may be propagated between an 
earth station and a terrestrial station. The first, called "Mode I" by CCIR Study Group 5, is the propagation of 
radiowaves through the troposphere along paths essentially in the great circle plane between the transmitting and 
receiving stations. The second, called "Mode 2", is the propagation ofradiowaves due to scattering from volumes in 
the troposphere which may be, but are usually not, in the great circle plane. 

Three different predicted interference levels are calculated in MICS: 

a) Long-Term, Mode 1, interference level which is the interference level exceeded 20% of the time due to 
Mode I propagation and is designated I (20% T) or I (20% S) is spherical earth propagation is used. 
b) Short-Term, Mode I, interference level which is the interference level exceeded 0.01% of the time due to 
Mode I propagation and is designated 1(0.0lo/oT). 
c) Short-Term, Mode 2, interference level which is the interference level exceeded 0.01% of the time due to 
Mode 2 propagation and is designated 1(0.0 I o/oP) 
TSIP Reference Manual 3.4-5 Fall 1996 


To facilitate the interference calculations for Mode 1 and Mode 2 propagation, the world has been divided into 

11Radio-Climatic Zones11 and "Rain-Climatic Zones11 

• 

3.4.4.2 Radio Climatic Zones 
The radio climatic zone is part of the earth station site record (radio field). The radio zone parameter is used in the 
Mode 1 long-term (20% Tropospheric) and short-term (0.01% Tropospheric) transmission loss calculations. 

The radio climatic zones as defined by the ITU (Radio Regulation, Appendix 28, 1982) are the following: 

Zone A -Entirely land 

Zone B -seas, oceans and substantial bodies of inland waters (as a criterion of a 
substantial body of water, one which can encompass a circle of diameter 100 
km) at latitudes greater than 23 .5 N or S, but excepting the Black Sea and the 
Mediterranean. 

Zone C -seas, oceans and substantial bodies of inland water, at latitudes less 
than 23.5 Nor S, and the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. 

Depending on the geographical location of the earth station, the MICS user has to decide which zone (obviously A 
or B for Canada) is to be recorded in the radio field. Note that radio is a mandatory field; if values are not recorded 
by the user the pdfwill not pass the validation program.

3.4.5.1 Long-Tenn Propaaation Mode 1Basic Transmission Loss

d = distance between the terrestrial and the earth station, in 
km. 

f = frequency in GHz. 

The distance between the interfering and victim stations, d in km, is calculated by TSIP from the geographical 
coordinates, which are part of the pdf being analyzed and environment records. 

3.4.5.2 Loo~•Tenn Propa~ation Mode I Interference Power Level 
The long-term propagation Mode I interference power level is calculated in TS-ES as follows: 

I (20%T) = P(T) • AFSL (T) + G (T, effec.) -L (20%) + G (R, effec.) • AFSL (R) {dBW) 

Where: 

I (20%T)= Propagation Mode I interference power level at the input of the victim receiver, not exceeded 
for all but 20% ofthe time, in dBW. 

P{T)= transmit power of the interfering station, measured at the output of the transmitter, in dBW. 
This value is stored in the pwrtx field ofthe TS channel record {TSIP will convert it from dBm 

0 

to dBW) and in the max txpower ofthe ES channel record. 

AFSL{T)= transmit antenna feeder system loss, in dB. This value is stored in the afsltxl field of the TS 
channel record and in the afsltx field ofthe ES antenna record. 

G(T, effec.) = effective transmit antenna gain; that is the gain of the interfering station antenna in the direction 
of the victim station, in dBi. Calculated by TSIP from the antenna records and calculated 
discrimination angle. 

L(20%) = basic transmission loss between the terrestrial and the earth station, exceeded for all but 20% of 
the time, in dB (see 3.4.5.1 above). 

G(R, effec.) = effective antenna gain of the victim receiver; that is the antenna gain of the victim station in the 
direction of the interfering station, in dBi. Calculated by TSIP from the antenna record and 
caluclated discrimination angle. 

AFSL{R)= receive antenna feeder system loss, in dB. This value is stored in the afslrx field; channel 
record of the TS and antenna record ofthe ES. 

The value of P(T) is part ofthe channel record. The value used, however, depends on the type of analysis (Band, or 
Plan/Channel). This is discussed later in this section, under the specific analysis types. 

The values of G(T, effec.) and G(R, effec.), corresponding to the antenna codes, are obtained by TSIP from the 
Antenna Subsidiary Table. To do this TSIP (in TS-ES mode) has to calculate first the "discrimination angles" ofthe 
antennas. 

Summer1995 3.4-8 TSIP Reference Manual 


The discrimination angle, of the interfering station, is the angle between the direction of maximum gain of the 
interfering station and the direction from the interfering to the victim station. 

The discrimination angle, of the victim station, is the angle between the direction of maximum gain of the victim 
station and the direction from the victim to the interfering station. 

An important remark has to be made here: the discrimination angle for an earth station antenna takes into 
consideration the service arc recorded for that station (SARC 2 Record). In fact, it is the worst-case discrimination 
angle (highest interfering level) within the service arc ofthe antenna. 

3.4.6 Short-Tenn Propagation Mode I Calculations 
3.4.6.J Short-Term Propagation Mode 1Basic Transmission Loss 
The short-term basic transmission loss is calculated in TS-ES by using equations derived from Appendix 28 of the 
ITU Radio Regulations. 
The short-term basic transmission loss is given by: 

L (0.01%) =Ao+ Bd + Ah (dB) 

Where: 
L(0.01%) = basic transmission loss, between the terrestrial and the earth station, exceeded for all but 0.01% ofthe 

time, in dB. 

Ao= 120 + 20 log f(dB) 

f= frequency, in GHz 

B = rate of attenuation, in dB/km 
d = distance between the terrestrial and earth stations, in km 
Ah = horizon angle correction, in dB 
Ah= 201og (I + 4.5 f 12E) + (f13) E (dB), for E>0(degrees) 

Ah= SE (dB), for -0.5<E<0(degrees) 
Ah= -4 (dB), for E<~0.5(degrees) 

E = antenna horizon elevation angle, in degrees 
Ifthe calculated value ofAh is greater than 30(dB), Ah should be set at 30(dB). 
~: Since there are no horizon elevation angle records for terrestrial antennas, the value Ah is not calculated by 

TS-ES (i.e. Ah = 0). Otherwise, the transmission loss calculated from ES-to-TS would be different to the J TS-to-ES. Ifthe user wants to include Ah in manual post-analysis, the auxiliary program HORLOSS can 
be used.

Calculation ofthe Rate of Attenuation 

The rate of attenuation, for each one of the radio climatic zones, is calculated as the sum of 3 components: oxygen 
attenuation, water vapour attenuation, and all other factors except atmospheric gases. 

Radio Climatic Zone A Oxygen 
attenuation: 

I I I }
B(O)=6.8x!0"3xf [ + 2+ dB/km)(60-if (60+1) (r2 
)+o.36 
Where: 
B(O) = rate ofattenuation due to oxygen, in dB/km 
f = frequency, in GHz 
Water vapour attenuation:

B(V)=3.sx10·4 + I 2 +3x(I0-6)xl2(dB/km)

(1-22.3/1) +9/ I (1+22.3/1) 

Where: 
B(V) = rate of attenuation due to water vapour, in dB/km 
f = frequency, in GHz 
All effects except atmospheric gases attenuation 
B (z) = 0.154 (I+ 3.05 log f)°"4 x (0.9028 + 0.0486 log q)2 (dB/km) 
Where: 
B(z) = attenuation caused by all effects except atmospheric 

gases, in (dB/km) 
f = frequency in GHz 
q =%ofthe time, q = 0.01 
Rate ofattenuation for radio climatic zone A, B(A): 
B(A) = B(o) + B(v) + B(z) (dB/km) 

Summer1995 3.4 -10 TSIP Reference Manual 


Radio Climatic Zone B 


The oxygen attenuation for Zone B is the same as for Zone A. 

The water vapour attenuation for Zone B is twice the value for Zone A. 

The value ofB(z) for Zone Bis given by: 
B(Z,B) =(0.272 + 0.047 Jog q)2 (dB/km) 

Where q =0.01 
Therefore, the rate of attenuation for Zone B is: 
B(B) =B(o) + 2B(v) + B(Z,B) (dB/km) 

Radio Climatic Zone C The 
value ofB( o) is the same as Zone A. 

The value ofB (v) is 5 times the value ofZone A. 
The value ofB(z) is the same as Zone B. Therefore, the rate ofattenuation for Zone C is: 

B(c) =B(o) + 5 B(v) + B(z,B) 

The code for the radio climatic zone (A,B or C) is stored in the earth station records (radio field). Using that code 
TS-ES will automatically select the appropriate set ofequations. 

3.4.6.2 Short-Term Propagation Mode I Interference Power Level 
The calculation of the short-term interference power level differs, from the calculation for the Jong term case, only 
in the value ofthe basic transmission Joss employed in the equation. Therefore: 
I (0.0l¾T) =P(T)-AFSL (T) + G(T, effec.)-L(0.01%) + G (R, effec.)-AFSL (R) (dBW) 
Where: 
I (0.0J¾T) =Propagation Mode I interference power level at the input ofthe victim receiver, not exceeded for all 

but 0.01% ofthe time, in dBW. 

All other parameters are defined in 3.4.5.2, except L(0.01%) which is defined in 3.4.6.1.

0 

3.4.7.I Definition ofthe Problem 
CCIR propagation Mode 2 can be defined as the propagation of radiowaves, from interfering transmitters to victim 
receivers, due to scattering from volumes in the troposphere (e.g. heavy rain clouds or "rain cells") which may be, 
but are usually not, in the great circle plane (the great circle defined by the interfering and victim stations). · 

The problem can be subdivided into the geometrical problem of determining the path followed by the radiowave 
and the calculation of the interference power level (which is also a function of the first one). By far, the most 
difficult problem, in terms ofcomplexity ofthe program required, is the geometrical problem. 

3.4.7.2 Possible Cases ofBeam Intersection 
There are several possible cases of intersection between the earth station and terrestrial station antenna beams: 
Main beam to main beam intersection, called common volume in TS-ES (i.e. the earth station and the 
terrestrial station main beams intersect the same rain cell); 
Earth station main beam to terrestrial station secondary beam intersection (i.e. the rain cell is on the earth 

station antenna main beam, and a secondary beam coming from the terrestrial station intersects it); 
Terrestrial station main beam to earth station secondary beam (i.e. the rain cell is on the terrestrial antenna 
main beam and a secondary beam coming from the earth station intersects it); 

o 

Earth station secondary beam to terrestrial station secondary beam. This case is not considered in TS-ES. It 
is assumed that the antenna discrimination, (both are secondary beams), reduces the possibility of 
interference to negligible levels. 

TS-ES analyzes all these possible combinations, calculates the interference level for each one of them and selects 
the worst case (highest interference level). In these calculations the earth station antenna services arc, atmospheric 
refraction and maximum rain cell heights are taken into consideration. 

3.4.7.3 Propagation Mode 2 Transmission Loss Ca1cu1ation 
The short-term propagation Mode 2 transmission loss is calculated, in TS-ES, using equations taken from CCIR 
Report 724-1 and rain climatic zones and other information from CCIR Report 563-2. 
The propagation Mode 2 short-term (0.01 % of the time) transmission loss is given by: 
Ls (0.01) = 168 + 20 logr(B)-20 log f-13.2 log R + 10 logA(b)+ LR-G (B, effec.)+ AFSL (T) (dB) 
Where: 
Ls (0.01) =Propagation Mode 2 (Precipitation scatter) transmission loss exceeded for all but 0.0 I% ofthe time. 
r(B) = distance from Station B to the scattering volume, in km ("Station B" is defined below). 

f = frequency in GHz. 

Summer1995 3.4 -12 TSIP Reference Manual 


R = surface rainfall rate, in mm/hr (for the rain climatic zone 
recorded in the rain field ofthe earth station). 
JO log Ab= 0.005 x R0·1 (f-JO)J.7 (dB) for £l:JO (GHz) 
JO log Ab= 0 for f<JO (GHz)' 
LR= 0 for f J (GHz) 
LR= Ax 10-3 x f3.2 (dB) for. I,; f<IO (GHz) 
LR= Ax 10·2 x f2.2 (dB) for JO,; f(GHz) 

(The value ofthe constant A, as a function ofthe rain climatic zone is given in Table 3.4.1). 
G(B, effec.) = antenna gain os Station Bin the direction of the 

scattering volume, in dBi. 
AFSL(T) = total antenna feeder system loss (TS+ ES, feeder loss), in dB. 
Station B is defined in TS-ES as follows: 

for those cases where the scattering volume is on the earth station antenna main beam "Station B" is the 
terrestrial station; 

for those cases where the scattering volume is on the terrestrial station main beam "Station B" is the earth

) station; 

for common volume cases (i.e. both main beams intersect at the scattering volume) "Station B" is the one 
having the larger product of antenna beamwidth and distance from antenna to scattering volume. 

3.4.7.4 Propa~atioo Mode 2 Interference Power I,eve1 
The short-term propagation Mode 2 interference power level is calculated in TS-ES as: 
1(0.0l¾P) = P(T)-Ls(O.OJ) 
Where: 
1(0.0 I %P) = propagation Mode 2 (precipitation scatter) Interference power level not exceeded for all but 
0.01% of the time, in dBW. 
P(T) = transmit power ofthe interfering source, in dBW. 
Ls(0.01) = defined in Paragraph 3.4.7.3. 
It should be pointed out that in the calculation of Is(O.O I) only one of the antennas appears in the equation, the 

antenna of "Station B". This is because the other antenna defines the dimensions ofthe scattering volume, and does 
not appear explicitly in the equations.

1bree different interference levels (I levels) are calculated by TSIP in the ES-TS analysis: 

long-term tropospheric (CCIR Propagation Mode I) I level. This level is designated as 20%T in the ES-TS 
output report. 1(20%T) is the CCIR Propagation Mode I interference power level at the input of the victim 
receiver, in dBW, not exceeded for all but 20% of the time. In Band Analysis, 1(20%T) is calculated as per 
paragraph 3.4.5.2, assuming that P(T) = PTMAX -ED4 (dBW). PTMAX and ED4 are the maximum 
transmit power and energy dispersal factor, respectively, indicated in the earth station records. The ED4

the ES-TS output report. 1(0.0I¾P) is the CCIR Propagation Mode 2 interference power level at the input of 
the victim receiver, in dBW, not exceeded for all but 0.01% of the time. In Band Analysis, 1(0.0l¾P) is 
calculated as per paragraph 3.4.7.4 assuming P(T) = PTMAX -ED4 (dBW). PTMAX and ED4 are the

3.4.8.2 ES-TS Band Analysis Reqµjrements 
In ES-TS Band Analysis TSIP will select either CCIR or FCSA requirements. If the ES and TS stations are both 
owned by FCSA members who subscribe to the "Telesat-RAC-TAC" agreement, TSIP will select FCSA 
requirements, otherwise CCIR requirements will be selected. CCIR requirements will also be selected for nonFCSA 
and USA operators. 

The requirements are the following:

For FCSA operators who subscribe to the Telesat-RAC-TAC agreement, interference is considered to exist if: 

1(20%T) >= -158 -Margin (dBW); and/or 

1(0.0l¾T) >= -138 -Margin (dBW); and/or

Earth Station-Terrestrial Station <ES-TS) Interference; Plan/Channel Analysis 

3.4.9.1 ES-TS Plan/Channel Analysis ca Ratio or I Level Calculations 
In Plan/Channel Analysis TSIP ES-TS calculates three different carrier-to-interference (C/1) ratios or three different 
interference levels (I levels). 

The three I levels calculated in Plan/Channel Analysis are tbe same values defined for Band Analysis in paragraph 
3.4.8.1, with the exception of the value of P(T). In Plan/Channel Analysis the value of P(T) is tbe actual value of 
the channel transmit power. That is: P(T) = P(Channel), where P(Channel) is the value of the transmit power, of 
the channel under analysis, indicated in the earth station records. (Note !bat tbe ED4 factor is not considered in this 
case). 

The three C/1 ratios calculated by TSIP ES-TS are: 

long-term tropospheric, C/1 (20%T). This is the CCIR Propagation Mode I C/1 ratio at tbe input of the 
victim receiver, exceeded during all but 20% of the time. The carrier level, C, is calculated using tbe actual 
output power of the terrestrial station transmitter. The interference level is calculated as per paragraph 

3.4.5.2 using P(T) = P(Channel); 
short-term tropospheric, C/1 (0.0l¾T). This is the CCIR Propagation Mode I C/1 ratio at tbe input oftbe 
victim receiver, exceeded during all but 0.01% of the time. The carrier level, C, is calculated using the 
actual output power of the terrestrial station transmitter. The interference level is calculated as per paragraph 
3.4.6.2, using P(T) = P(Channel); 

short-term precipitation, C/1 (0.0l¾P). This is the CCIR propagation Mode 2 C/1 ratio at tbe input of the 
victim receiver, exceeded during all but 0.01 % of the time. The carrier level, C, is calculated using the 
actual output power oftbe terrestrial station transmitter. The interference level is calculated as per paragraph 
3.4.7.4, using P(T) = P(Channel). 

3.4.9.2 ES-TS P)an/Channe! Analysis Reqµjrements 
The required C/1 or I values in Plan/Channel Analysis are derived from appropriate carrier-to-interference (CT.)() 
curves. If, however, a CT.)( for the victim and interfering traffics under study cannot be found, TSIP ES-TS uses a 
required C/1 values of95 (dB) for frequency separations (between victim and interfering carriers) up to 500 (MHz), 

TSIP Reference Manual 3.4 -15 Summer1995 


and 0(dB) for separations greater than 500 (MHz). The CTI{ correction factors given in the table (next page) are 

applied to this value. 

The CTI{ curves are oftwo types: those that involve C/I values (RQWRST positive) and those that involve I values 
(RQWRST negative). 

Ifthe CTI{ appropriate for the case under study is a C/I CTI{ curve, TSIP ES-TS will apply a correction factor to the 
values obtained from the curve. The correction factors are the following: 

% ofthe Time and CTI{ Correction Factor 
Propagation Mode (ES-to-TS, dB) 

FCSA CCIR 

20%T -13.49 -23.49 
0.01%T -33.49 -37.49 
0.01%P -33.49 -37.49 

For example, if the value read from the CTI{ curve for a particular frequency separation is 65 (dB), and both 
operators are FCSA members subscribing to the Telesat-RAC-TAC agreement, the corrected C/I values will be: 

C/I (20%T) = 65 -13.49 = 51.51 (dB) 

C/I (0.01%T) = 65 -33.49 = 31.51 (dB) 

C/I (0.01%P) = 65 -33.49 = 31.51 (dB) 

Ifthe CTI{ is an I type CTI{, TSIP ES-TS will take the value corresponding to the particular frequency separation 
without any correction factor, other than converting it to dBW. In this case, the same requirement is applied for 
20%T, 0.01%T and 0.01%P. 

(For more details about the CTI{ curves see Annex B ofthis manual). 
Ifno CTI{ is found and the frequency separation between victim and interfering carriers is less than 500 (MHz), 

interference is considered to exist if: 
C/I (20%T) <= 95 + cor. factor+ Margin (dB); and/or 
C/I (0.01 %T) <= 95 + cor. factor+ Margin (dB); and/or 
C/I (0.01%P) <= 95 + cor. factor+ Margin (dB) 

Ifno CTI{ is found and the frequency separation is greater than 500 (MHz), interference is considered to exist if: 
C/I (20%T) <= 0(dB) + cor. factor+ Margin; and/or 
C/I (0.01%T) <= 0(dB) + cor. factor+ Margin; and/or 

C/I (0.01%P) <= 0(dB) + cor. factor+ Margin

3.4.10.1 TS-ES Band Analysis Interference Level Calculations 
TSIP TS-ES calculates the same 3 levels defined in paragraph 3.4.8.1 for the ES-TS case, but with the ES and TS 
roles interchanged. That is, the TS is the interfering station and the ES is the victim station in this case. 

-the long-term tropospheric propagation interference level, 1(20%T), is calculated as per paragraph 3.4.5.2, 
assuming P(T) = 13(dBW); 

-the short-term tropospheric propagation interference level, 1(0.0l¾T), is calculated as per paragraph 3.4.6.2, 
assuming P(T) = 13(dBW); 

the short-term precipitation scatter interference level, I(0.01%P), is calculated as per paragraph 3.4.7.4, 
assuming P(T) = 13 (dBW). 

3.4.10.2 TS-ES Band Analysis Requirements 
TSIP TS-ES obtains the interference requirements from the earth station link record. 
the long-term tropospheric, 20% Tropospheric, maximum allowed level of interference is taken directly from 
the ES records. (The value is recorded in the i20 field ofthe ES records); 
the short-term tropospheric requirement, 0.01% Troposhperic, is recorded on the it0l field of the ES channel 

record, 

the short-term precipitation scatter requirement, 1(0.01%P), is, recorded on the ip0I field of the ES channel 
records. 
The 3 maximum levels of interference are given in dBw. 
In TS-ES Band Analysis, interference is considered to exist if: 

TSIP Reference Manual 3.4 -17 Summer 1995 


I(20%T) >= i20 -Margin (dBW); and/or 

I(0.01%T) >= it0I -Margin (dBW); and/or 
I(0.01%P) >= ip0I -Margin (dBW) 

Where Margin is the value recorded on the TSIP parameter file (value selected by the user at the time of creating the 
TSIP parameter file). 

3.4.11 Terrestrial Station-Earth Station /TS-ES} Interference: Plan/Channel Analysis 
3.4.11.1 TS-ES Plan/Channel Analysis ca Ratio or I Level Calculations 
TSIP TS-ES calculates the same three C/1 ratios, or the same three I levels, defined in paragraph 3.4.9.1 for the ESTS 
case, but with the roles of the interfering and victim stations reversed. 
the long-tenn tropospheric propagation interference level, I(20%T), is calculated as per paragraph 3.4.5.2 
assuming P(T) =PTX -30 (dBW) (the factor 30 is applied to convert PTX to dBW); 
the short-tenn tropospheric propagation interference level, I(0.01%T), is calculated as per paragraph 3.4.6.2, 

assuming P(T) = PTX -30 (dBW); 
the short-tenn precipitation scatter interference level, l(0.01%P), is calculated as per paragraph 3.4.7.4, 

0 

assuming P(T) = PTX -30 (dBW). 
PTX is the value recorded on the pwrtx field ofthe TS channel record. 
The carrier level is taken directly from the ES records, that is: C = PRX (dBW), where PRX is the value recorded 

on the ES records (field pwrrx of the ES channel record). Therefore, the three carrier-to-interference ratios are: 
C/1 (20%T) = PRX -1(20%T) (dB); 
C/1 (0.01%T) = PRX -l(0.01%T) (dB); and 
C/1 (0.01%P) = PRX -I(0.01%P) (dB) 

3.4.11.2 TS-ES Plan/Channel Analysis Requirements 
Where an appropriate CTX curve can be found in the subsidiary files, TSIP TS-ES will use it to detennine the 
required C/1 values or maximum allowed interference levels. If, however, an appropriate CTX cannot be found, 
TSIP TS-ES will use the Band Analysis requirements for frequency separations, between victim and interfering 
carriers, up to 500 (MHz), and a requirement of 0 (dBW) interference level for frequency separations above 500 
(MHz). 

If an appropriate CTX is found, and the CTX is an I type CTX, the requirement obtained from the curve will be 

used by TSIP TSES without any correction. If the CTX is of the C/1 type, the following correction factors are 
applied:

3.4.12 Antenna Discrimination in Earth Station-Terrestrial Station Analysis () 
3.4.12.1 ES Service Arc Considerations 
The ES antenna discrimination value, used by TSIP in the calculation of the interference level, is the worst case 
(lowest attenuation) discrimination taking into consideration the service arc of the earth station. The service arc is 
part of the ES records. In fact, field SARCI of the ES records is the longitude of the center of the service arc and 
field SARC2 is the longitudinal variance with respect of the center. Therefore, the total service arc of the ES will 
extend from the value recorded on SARCI minus the value on SARC2, to the value on SARCI plus the value on 
SARC2. 

Ifthe value specified in SARC2 is not zero, TSIP divides the ES antenna service arc into incremental segments. 
Each segment will be equal to the maximum of one degree or the value recorded on SARC2 divided by 9.5. For 
each incremental segment TSIP calculates the elevation angle to the orbit and defines a beam vector (ES vector). 
For example, if the value specified in SARCI is 115 and the value in SARC2 is 3 the incremental segments would 
be I each, and the beam vectors would have the longitudes: 

115,116,117,118 and 114,113,112 

Ifthe value in SARCI is, for example, 115 and the value in SARC2 is 19, the segments would be (19/9.5) =2. The 
beam vector longitudes would then be: 

115, 117, 119, ..... , 133, 135 and 113, 111, ..... , 97, 95 

(The maximum number ofbeam vectors is 21). 

0 

From the geometry of the geostationary orbit and location of the ES, TSIP calculates the elevation angle for each 
one ofthe longitudes ofthe service arc and defmes the ES vectors. 

TSIP also determines the direction from the ES antenna to the TS antenna and defmes the ET vector. The ES 
antenna discrimination angle is, then, the angle between the ET vector and the ES vector. TSIP calculates this angle 
for each one of the ES vectors of the service arc and, with these angles, calculates the discrimination from the ES 
antenna pattern. The minimum value is selected by TSIP as the ES antenna discrimination. 

3.4.12.2 ES-TS Beam Axis Vector 
The earth station -terrestrial station beam vector (ET vector) used in TSIP, takes into consideration the effects of 
atmospheric refraction. Firstly, TSIP calculates the azimuth and elevation from the ES to the TS without 
considering refraction. Secondly, the elevation angle is corrected, including now the effects of refraction. Then the 
refracted ET vector, which has the original azimuth and the corrected elevation is defmed. 

Once the refracted ET vector is generated, TSIP checks the ES radio horizon data (which is part of the ES records) 
to determine whether the earth station -terrestrial station path is blocked by the earth's surface. Ifit is blocked, the 
elevation angle of the ET vector is set equal to the horizon elevation angle. For example: the elevation of the 
refracted ET vector is -0.15 and the ES to TS distance is 20 km. Also, the ES radio horizon data indicates that, for 
the azimuth ofthe ET vector, the elevation ofthe ES radio horizon is 0.1 and the distance to the radio horizon is 15 
km. 

Summer1995 3.4-20 TSIP Reference Manual 


In this case, since the ES to TS distance is greater than the distance from the ES to the radio horizon and the 
elevation ofthe radio horizon is greater than the elevation of the ET vector, TSIP would set the elevation of the ET 
vector at 0.1. 

3.4.12.3 ES Radio Horizon Data 
As explained in the previous paragraph, the ES radio horizon data can affect the value of the ET vector elevation 
and, therefore, the value of the ES antenna discimination. The ES radio horizon data is part of the ES records 
(me_ azim table). The azimuth record contains the radio horizon data recorded in sets offour values. The first value 
is the azimuth, in degrees with one decimal place. The second value is the radio horizon elevation angle, in degrees 
with one decimal place, corresponding to the azimuth in the same record. The third value is the distance between 
the ES and the radio horizon, in km with two decimal places, corresponding to the azimuth in the same record. The 
fourth record is the obstruction loss, if any, corresponding to the particular azimuth. 

The user can record up to 144 records on the me_azim table. For calculating the elevation angle and distance to the 
radio horizon, corresponding to an azimuth which is not recorded on the table, TSIP interpolates linearly between 
the two adjacent azimuth values. 

If no data is recorded by the user on the azimuth table, TSIP assumes that the elevation angle to the radio horizon is 
0.0, and the distance between the ES and the radio horizon is 1.00 km. 

3.4.12.4 TS-ES Beam Axis Vector 
The total antenna discrimination between the terrestrial and earth stations, is equal to the ES antenna discrimination 

) plus the TS antenna discrimination. The method used by TSIP to calculate the ES discrimination is explained in the 
previous paragraphs. The TS antenna discrimination is a function of the off-axis angle at the TS antenna. This is 
the angle between the TS beam axis vector and the vector from the TS to the ES (TE vector). The TE vector 
generated by TSIP takes into account the effect of refraction. Also, if the distance between the ES and the horizon, 
at the azimuth corresponding to the ES to TS direction, is less than the distance from the ES to the TS and the 
elevation angle of the horizon is greater than the elevation angle from the TS to the ES, TSIP uses the horizon 
elevation angle as the elevation of the TE vector. 

Once the TE vector is generated, TSIP calculates the angle (UTE in the report) between the vector joining the two 
terrestrial stations (TU vector) and the TE vector. Using this angle TSIP determines the TS antenna discrimination 
from the appropriate antenna pattern. 

3.4.12.5 CCJR Code Antennas 
For ES antennas that have ACODE starting with CCIR, the following rules apply: 

-The first two numbers of the code are the receive antenna gain; 

-the last two numbers ofthe code are the transmit antenna gain; 

-the pattern is given by CCIR Rec. 465-1 as follows: 

Discrimination=0( dB) 0<angle<= 1.0( degree) 

=AGAIN-32+25log(angle) (dB) I .0<angle<=48( degrees) 

=AGAIN+I0 (dB) 48<angle

TS-TS TSIP Parameter File 

Once the pdf that is to be analyzed has been prepared, and validated, (see the VALIDA TE section in the User 
Guide) the user has to decide on the mode of interference analysis which is required and establish the set of 
commands that will control it, i.e. create the parameter file. 

There are several commands, selected by the user, that control a TS-TS run. A discussion of them is included here, 
more operational details are given in the TSIP section ofthe MICS User Guide. 

The commands that control a TSIP run are selected by the user on screen 3.1.A "TSIP Parameters". This screen is

This fielc\ will indicate to TSIP whether the user is submitting for analysis a 
Terrestrial (T) or Earth station (E) file, In TS-TS analysis the only valid option is 

"T". 

In this field the user enters the name of the file being submitted for analysis. This 
name shall match exactly the pdfname on Screen I.I, "TS PDF Maintenance". Also, 
the file has to be valid for TSIP; i.e. the VALIDATE status code (right column on 

11T11

screen 1.1) has to be 11U11 
, or 11S11. If this is not the case TSIP will report an error 

condition. · 

The cursor will go to this field only if the Env File Type selected above is PDF_ TS. 
The user will enter the environment file name. This name shall match exactly the 
naine of the TS file on Screen I.I and the file has to be valid for TSIP (i.e. status U, 
Tor S). 

This field will indicate to TSIF° if the user wants to execute an "Orbit Intersection 
analysis" (see section 3.5). The default value in this field is "N", that means TSIP 
will not perform an orbit intersection analysis unless the user changes it to "Y". 

The user has 4 options, # I to # 4. Option #1 is CCIR-SJM model, #2 is spherical 
earth model, #3 is Free space and #4 is PCS-HA TA model. The algorithms used in 
these calculations are discussed in section 3.3.3. 

In this field the user selects the maximum frequency separation (between interfering 
and victim carrier frequencies) to be used in the TSIP analysis. TSIP will use the 
figure entered by the user if the distance between the interfering and victim stations 
is greater than one half ofthe selected coordination distance. Ifthe distance between 
the interfering and victim stations is equal or less then one half of the selected 
coordination distance, TSIP will default to the greater of: 

the value entered by the user and 300 MHz, if the interfering and victim traffic 

codes are not PCS codes; 

the value entered by the user and 150 MHz, if the interferer and/or victim traffic 

is a PCS code. 

The figure entered in this field will indicate to TSIP the coordination area of the 
analysis. The coordination area, in TSIP, is a circle centered on the TS site and with 
a radius equal to the coordination distance selected by the user. TSIP will draw this 
circle for each station in the file submitted for analysis. All stations from the 
environment which are located within these circles will be selected for further 
analysis. 

This parameter is used to sensitize the interference analysis in terms of maximum 
acceptable interference level, or minimum acceptable carrier to· interference ratio; 
default value is 0( dB). The maximum acceptable carrier to interference ratio (C/1) as 
a function of frequency separation are stored in the MICS subsidiary (sd _ ctx and 
sd _ ctxd) tables, called "CTX" tables. Ifthe user does not enter any values in this 
Required Margin field, TSIP will use the default value (0dB). This means that TSIP 

will report all those cases which do not meet the CTX requirement for this particular 
frequency separation. Ifthe user enters a positive value, TSIP will use this value as a

default value is 0( dB). The maximum acceptable carrier to interference ratio (C/1) as 
a function of frequency separation are stored in the MICS subsidiary (sd_ctx and

Required Margin field, TSIP will use the default value (0dB). This means that TSIP 
will report all those cases which do not meet the CTX requirement for this particular 
frequency separation. Ifthe user enters a positive value, TSIP will use this value as a 
"safety margin", and will report all those cases which do not meet the CTX 
requirement plus the margin. Although negative margin values can be entered, they 
should not be used in general; they are useful only for special cases of post-analysis 

or for testing the program. 

For a discussion of interference requirements see paragraphs 3.3.1.4, 3.3.2.2, 3.4.8.2, 

3.4.9.2, 3.4. I 1.2 and Appendix B. 

The user can select one of three available options: BAND, CHAN or PLAN, (see 
paragraphs 3.1.1, 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 respectively). 

Valid options are any combination of numbers from I to 9, separated by commas, or 
"ALL". This field will indicate to TSIP which environment channels to analyze. If 
the user inputs "5", for example, TSIP will select only channels with status code 5 
(licensed channels) from the environment. Ifthe selection is ALL, TSIP will look at · 
all channels, regardless of their status codes. For a table of status codes see 
Appendix A. 

This field is used only if the pdf submitted to analysis contains temporary antenna

• Depending on the option selected, 

TSIP will look at stations located in Canada, or in the US or in both countries. 

Valid options are "ALL", "ALL EXCEPT SELF", "CALL SIGN" and "OPERATOR 
CODE". Ifthe user enters ALL, TSIP will analyze all environment sites which meet 
previous culling criteria. Ifthe user enters ALL EXCEPT SELF, TSIP will analyze 
all environment stations, which meet previous culling criteria, except those which 
belong to the user (the "user" is identified in the operator field of the pdf submitted 
to analysis). 

In the first two of the selections above, the cursor will go directly to the TSIP Run

CALL SIGN (Table): The user will enter in this table all the environment call signs he/she has selected for 

this interference analysis. This option is used, in general, when the user knows of a 
site, or sites, which are potential interference cases with the file under study. TSJP 
will look, in this case, only to those environment sites selected by the user; it will be 
a limited but faster analysis. The user can introduce changes to his/her proposed file 
and repeat the analysis against the selected environment call signs, which will allow 
the user to observe the effect produced by the changes to the pdf. 

OPER. CODES (Table): The user will enter in this table all the environment operator codes he/she has 
selected for this analysis. This could be just his/her own company code, for 
example. In this case TSIP would look only to those stations in the environment that 
belong to the user (this would be a TSIP analysis in Protect mode, since it is only 
looking at the user's stations). Or the user could select the operator code(s) of 
companies he/she is doing the analysis on behalf of. 

TSIP Run Name: This is a suffix added by TSIP to the TSJP tables root name. Note that TSIP writes 
the analysis to Ingres tables. If a TSIP study is repeated and the root name of the 
study (i.e. name of the parameter file) or the TSIP Run Name are not changed, the 
tables of the first study will be overwritten. Then if the user wants to repeat an 
interference analysis ( e.g. after changing name of the proposed pdf parameters) and 
wants to preserve the results of the first analysis, the TSIP Run Name should be 
changed. 

Report fype: TS-TS TSIP can produce up to 5 different output reports, in addition to the ORBIT 
report if this is requested. The user has to say "Y" or "N" for each of the reports, 
whether he/she wants them produced or not. The default condition is all "Y". For a

discussion ofthe contents of these reports see section 4.2.1. 

3.3.1 TS-TS Band Analysis Calculations 
3.3.1.0 General 
Interference calculations in Band analysis are based on several assumptions concerning power levels, transmission 
losses, interference criteria, etc. All these assumptions are discussed in the foUowing paragraphs. 

3.3.1.1 Victim Hop Receive Power 
In Band analysis no specific RF channel frequencies are analyzed by TSIP. Therefore it was agreed, by the 
members of the MICS Technical group, to use the parameters of the first listed channel in both, the user's pdf 
submitted to analysis and the station from the environment (remember that TSIP analyzes the stations by pairs, one 
from the proposed pdf and one from the environment). 

The receive signal level at the receiver of the victim hop, is calculated as follows: 

PRx = Pwrtx (!)-afsltxl(I) + AGainTx(I)-Path Loss+ AGain Rx(!)-afslrxl(I) (dBm) 

Where: 

PRx: receive signal level at the victim receiver input, in dBm. 

Fall 1996 3.3-4 TSIP Reference Manna! 


Pwrtx(l): transmit power, in dBm, of the first channel of the (remote) victim station. This 
value is stored in the pwrtx field of this channel record. 

afsltxl(l): antenna feeder system loss, in dB, of the main transmitter of the first channel of the 
(remote) victim station. This value is stored in the afsltxl field of this channel 
record. 

AGain Tx(l): antenna gain, in dBi, of the main transmit antenna of the first channel of the 
(remote) victim station. The antenna number of this antenna is stored in the 
antnumbtxl field of this channel record. 

Path Loss: is the propagation loss, in dB, from the (remote) victim hop transmitter to the victim 
receiver, calculation of path loss is discussed in paragraph 3.3.3. 

AGain Rx(]): is the antenna gain•, in dBi, of the main receiver of the first channel of the victim 
station. The antenna number of this antenna is stored in the antnumbrxl field of this 
channel record. 

afslrxl(l): antenna feeder system loss, in dB, of the main receiver of the first channel of the 
victim station. This value is stored in the afslrxl field of this channel record. 

3.3. 1.2 Interfering Signal Level 
The interfering signal level at the receiver of the victim hop, is calculated as follows: 

) I= pwrtxi(l)-afsltxli(l) +AGainTxi(l)-Path Loss (i) +AGainRx(l)-afslrxl -Ant Disc (Worst) (dBm) 

Where: 

I: interfering signal level at the input of the victim station receiver, in dBm. 
pwrtxi(l): transmit power, in dBm, of the first channel of the interfering station. This value is 
stored in the pwrtx field of this channel record. 

afsltxli(l): antenna feeder system loss, in dB, of the main transmitter of the first channel of the 
interfering station. This value is stored in the afsltz(l) of this channel record. 

AGain Txi(l): antenna gain, in dBi, of the main transmit antenna of the first channel of the 
interfering station. The antenna number of this antenna is stored in the antnumbtxl 
field of this channel record. 

Path Loss (i): is the propagation loss, in dB, from the interfering transmitter to the victim receiver. 
Calculation of path loss is discussed in Paragraph 3.3.3. 

AgainRx(l) and afslrxl(l) are defined above. 

Ant Disc (Worst): is the worst case sum (i.e. minimum) of the transmit (interfering) plus the receive 
(victim) antenna discriminations. This is calculated in this way since in Band 
analysis no specific RF channel polarities are defined. Calculation of the antenna II-' 
discrimination is discussed in section 3.3.4. YI.

3.3.1.3 Carrier-to-Interference Ratio in Band Analysis 
The carrier-to-interference ratio in Band analysis is given by: 

C/1 =Prx -I (dB) 

Where Prx is calculated as per paragraph 3 .3. I.I and I is calculated as per paragraph 3 .3. I. I.

Interfering is defined to exist in band analysis if: 

C/I < ll0(dB) 

Where C/1 is the carrier to interference ratio calculated as per Paragraph 3.3.1.3. 

If no margin (see Required Margin in 3.3.0) has been entered by the user in the TSIP parameter file, TSIP will 
report.all cases whose C/1 is less than 110 (dB). If a margin is inputted by the user, TSIP will report all those cases 
whose margin· is less than 11 0(dB) plus this margin (i.e. if the user inputs a margin of SdB TSIP will report all cases 
where the C/I is less than l 15dB) 

3.3 .2 TS-TS Plan and Channel Analysis Calculations 
0

3.3.2.0 General 
In Plan and Channel analysis specific frequencies, traffic and equipment types are taken into consideration. The 
carrier-to-interference ratio (C/1), or the interference signal power level (I), is calculated for those specific 
parameters (frequency, traffic type, etc.) and compared to the requirements obtained from the carrier-to-interference 
(CTX) tables. In PLAN mode the parameters of the "PLANNED" channels are taken from the first channel record 
with the same antenna keys, i.e. local call sign, remote call sign, Band Code and antenna number. 

3.3.2.1 C and I calculation in Plan/Channel Analysis 
Receive Carrier level 


The receive carrier level is calculated using the actual transmit power (PTX) ofthe victim transmitter. Therefore: 

C = PTX (Victim) -AFSL (Victim, Tx) + AGAIN (Victim, Tx) 
-Path Loss (victim) + AGAIN (Victim, Rx) -AFSL (Victim, Rx) 

= EIRP (Victim) -Path Loss (victim)+ AGAIN (Victim, Rx)

corresponds to this channel record. 

Path Loss (victim): propagation loss between victim hop transmitter and receiver, in (dB). Calculated 
as in paragraph 3.3.3 for the transmit frequency ofthis channel. 

AGAIN (Victim, Rx): victim receive antenna gain (at the victim hop receiving site), in (dBi). The antenna 
number of this antenna is stored in the antnumbrxl, antnumbrx2 or antnumbrx3 
(whether the case under study is the main, diversity! or diversity2 receiver) of the 
channel record of the victim channel under analysis. Actual antenna codes are 
stored in the antenna record corresponding to this channel. 

AFSL (Victim, Rx): victim site receive antenna feeder system loss, in (dB). This value is stored in the 
afslrxl, afslrx2 or afslrx3 (whether the case under study is the main, diversity! or) diversity2 receiver) field ofthe channel record ofthe victim channel under study. 

EIRP (Victim): victim (remote) transmit EIRP, in (dBm). 
EIRP = PTX -AFSL + AGAIN. 

Interference level 


The interfering level in plan/channel analysis is also calculated using the actual value of the output power of the 
interfering transmitter and actual value of the antenna discrimination:

stored in the aptnumbtxl field ofthe channel record ofthe interfering channel under 

analysis. The actual antenna code is stored in the antenna record corresponding to 
this channel. 

Path Loss (int): propagation loss between the interring transmitter and victim receiver, in (dB). 
Calculated as per section 3.3.3 for the transmit frequency of this interfering channel.

EIRP (int) = PTX (int) -AFSL (int) + AQAIN (int) 

ANTDISC (total) = ANTDJSC (int) + ANTDISC (Victim, Rx) 

3.3.2.2 C/1 or I Requirements in Plan and Channel Analysis (CTX Tables) 
Interference analysis calculations provide the level of interference, I, or the carrier-to-interference ratio, C/1, which 
appears at the input ofthe victim receiver. To determine whether the calculated interference level, or the calculated 
C/1, is acceptable, the calculated value must be compared with the maximum acceptable level of interference, or the 

0

minimum C/1 ratio, required at the input of the victim receiver. 

Interference is considered to exist whenever one ofthe following conditions is met: 

I (calculated)> I (maximum acceptable) 

C/1 ( calculated) < C/1 (minimum required) 

Maximum acceptable values of interference and minimum required C/1 ratios are stored in MICS in the "CTX 
Tables". A CTX table indicates, for a given combination ·of desired and interfering traffic and receive equipment, 
the maximum acceptable level of interference, or the minimum C/1 ratio required by the victim receiver, as a 
function of the frequency separation between desired and interfering carriers. 

The maximum acceptable I and minimum required C/1 values listed on the CTX's, are derived from transmission 
standards (e.g. allowable interference noise in a VF channel; allowable degradation of the fade margin of a hop) 
agreed upon by all FCSA member companies. More infonnation about these requirements and derivation of the 
CTX's, can be found in the "Microwave Frequency Coordination Engineering Considerations". A complete 
description ofthe CTX tables is given in Annex B of this manual. ·

Although a complete description of the CTX's is given in Annex B of this manual, some conventions or decisions 
made by the program, which directly affect the interference calculation reports, are discussed in here. 

a) CTX Cross-reference tables Once 
the C/1 or I value has been calculated, as explained in previous paragraphs of this section, the appropriate CTX 
has to be found in the CTX Subsidiary tables. The CTX's are defined in terms of three parameters: desired traffic 
(TFCR), interfering traffic (TFCI) and receive equipment (EQPR). All these 3 parameters are part of the proposed 
pdf and environment specified by the user (the environment may be the MICS microwave database). The program, 
therefore, looks for a CTX having the specified TFCR:TFCI:EQPR. If there is no such CTX, the program uses the 
cross-reference, CTX listed in the ctx_xref table. This table is maintained by the FCSA Database Administrator and 
is based on the following search sequence: 

Sequence Desired Traffic Interfering Traffic Receive Equipment 

I TFCR TFCI EQPR 
2 TFCR TFCI XEQPR 
3 TFCR TFCI DFLT 
4 TFCR XTFCI EQPR 
5 TFCR XTFCI XEQPR 
6 · TFCR XTFCI DFLT 
7 XTFCR TFCI EQPR

) 8 XTFCR TFCI XEQPR 
9 XTFCR TFCI DFLT 
JO XTFCR XTFCI EQPR 
11 XTFCR XTFCI XEQPR 
12 XTFCR XTFCI bFLT 

Where: 

TFCR Victim traffic type 
XTFCR Cross-reference to TFCR, if available 
TFCI Interfering traffic type 
XTFCI Cross-reference to TFCI, if available 
EQPR Receive equipment type 
XEQPR Cross-reference to EQPR, if available 
DFLT Default (blank) EQPR 

Searching along this chain stops as soon as a valid CTX table is found, 

If the particular CTX searched for by TSIP is not in the ctx_xref table, the program defaults to the "worst -case 
CTX".

3.3.3 Path Loss Calcualtions 
0 

3.3.3.0 General 
TS-TS TSIP includes 4 models for the calcualtions of the TS-TS propagation loss and provision was made for a 
future fifth option. These propagation loss calcualtions models are selected onteh TSIP paramter file screen. 
The optiosn are:. 

I. CC:IR-SJM (already in use.in TSIP, TS-TS and TS-ES) 
2. Spherical EArth (CCIR ,method, already available in TS-ES) 
3. Free Space Loss 
4. PCS-HATA (in accordance with TIA Bulletin JOG; as recommended by MTG WG's EP and 
EO). 
5. OH LOSS propagation loss calculations (future option). 
This option will include a digital terrain database, a profile builder program and an OH LOSS 
calculation module. · 

Defaults are Option #1 for TS-ES and Option #3 for TS-TS (as it was in the VAX). 

Option #4 should only be selected for proposed files which contain PCS traffic codes (i.e. "PS****" codes). 
Otherwise TSIP will interrupt the run and write an error message to ihe destination file.

3.3.3.1 CCIR-SJM Propagation Loss Model 
This propagation loss calculation model has been in use in TSIP since its creation. 
In this model free space propagation loss is assumed if the distance between transmitter and receiver is equal or less 
than 90(km). Free space propagation loss is calculated as follows: 
Path Loss= 32.45 + 20 log d + 20 log f (dB) 
Where: 
Path Loss: is the propagation loss, in dB, from transmitter to receiver. 

d: is the distance between transmitter and receiver, in km. 
d is the distance between victim hop transmitter and receiver, for the victim hop, and the 
distance between interfering transmitter and victim receiver, for the interfering path. 
f: frequency, in MHz 
Note: In Band analysis fis the frequency ofthe first channel in the PDF or MDB channel 
record 

If the distance is greater than 90 km but equal or less than 160 km, the propagation loss is calculated as: 

Path Loss = -300 + 190 log d + 20 log f (dB) 
(parameters as defined above) 

Fall 1996 3.3 -10 TSIP Reference Manual, 


Ifthe distance is greater than 160 (km), the propagation is calculated as: 

Path Loss = -58 + 80 log d + 20 log f (dB) 
(parameters as defined above) 

3.3.3.2 CCJR Spherical Earth Propagation Loss Calculation Model 
This propagation loss calculation method is based on CCIR Report 238-6. 

The algorithm used in MICS for calculating the TS-TS TSIP Spherical Earth propagation loss is described in the 
following paragraphs. 

Antenna Heights 

The antenna heights used in this algorithm relate to TSIP antenna heights as follows: 

The antenna height in meteres is read from ft_***_ante.aht, when the station belongs to the proposed file, or from 
mt_ante.ah!, when the station belongs to the environment. 

HTx = aht(int) + intgmd is the antenna height ofthe interfering transmit station; 

HRx = aht(vic) + vicgmd is the antenna height ofthe victim receiving station. 

Transition Distance

) 

The transition distance, Dh in km, is defined as follows: 

5 5

Dh = 4.123* ( HTx0· + HRx0· ) 

It is the added distance to the common horizon ofthe interfereing and victim stations. 

Spherical Earth Propagation Loss Calcualtion 

a) Ford> Dh the Spherical Earth propagation loss is calcualted as follows: 
Ploss = 29.73 + 30*1og(Fmhz)+I0*log(d)+30*1og(theta)+N(H,h) 

Where: 
Ploss = tt_***_chan.pathloss 
Fmhz = tt_•••_chan.intfreqtx in Mhz 
d = tt_***_site.intlvicldist 
theta = (d -Dh)/8.5 
H = theta*d/4000 
h = l.063*(theta2)*(10"3) 
N(H,h) = 20*1og(5 + 0.27*H) + 1.17261 *h 

. b) For d <= Dh the Spherical Earth propagation loss is calcualted as free space propagation loss: 


Ploss = 32.45 + 20*1og(d) + 20*1og(FMHz)

3.3.3.3 Free Space Prqpagation Loss Calculatiqn Mqdel 
0 

In this model free space propagation loss is calcualted for any pair of interferer and victim stations, regardless of site 
altitude or antenna height. The loss is calcualted as: 

Ploss= 32.45 + 20*log(d) + 20*log(Frequency) 
where d is the path length in km and the frequency is in MHz. 

3.3.3.4 PCS-HA TA Prnpagation Lqss Calcualtiqn Model 
This model is to be used only for the PCS versus fixed point-to-point microwave radio interference analysis. 
This model has been implemented into TSIP following the algorithms described in TIA Bulletin IOG (Annex F). 
The algorithms are described in the following paragraphes. 

These algorithms will be used in MICS for calcualting the propagation loss between a PCS and a fixed service 
microwave radio station. 
Antenna Heights 
The antenna heights used in this algorithm relate to TSIP heights as follows: 

If interfering transmitting station is the PCS station, then interferer (aht) = Hpcs and victim(aht) = 
Hmw. The interfering Tx station is the PCS station iftt_•••_chan.inttraftx = "PS****". 

0

Ifthe victim receiving statation is the PCS station, then interferer(aht) = Hmw and victim(aht) = Hpcs. 
The victim Rx station is the PCS station if tt_***_chan.victrafrx = "PS****". 

Note that aht is the antenna height in meters, read from ft_•••_ante.ah!, when the station belongs to the proposed 
file, or from mt_ante.aht, when the station belongs to the environment. 
Then; interferer(aht) = aht(int) + intgmd 
victim(aht) = aht(vic) + vicgrnd 

Transition Distance 

The transition distance, Dh in km, is defined as follows: 

Dh = 4.123*(Hpcs0
·' + Hmw0
·') 

This is the added distance to the common horizon.

Propagation Loss Beyond the Horizon 

For d > Dh the following equation will apply: 

Ploss= 29.73 + 30 * log(Fmhz) + I0*log (d) + 30 * log(theta) + N(H,h) 

Where 

Ploss = tt_***_chan.patloss 
Fmhz = tt_***_ chan.intfreqtx in Mhz 
d = tt_ ***_site.inti vie! dist 
theta= (d -Dh) /8.5 
H = theta*d/4000 
h = l.063*(theta2) * (10"3) 
N(H,h) = 20*log(5+0.27*H)+ 1.17261*h 

· Propagation Loss Within the Transition Zone 

a) Ford <= Dh and Hpcs <= 60, the propagation loss is calcualted as follows: 
Ploss = 69.55 + 26.16*1og (Fmhz) -13.82*log(Hmw) + [44.9 -6.55*log(Hmw)]*log(d) 2*[
1og(Fmhz/28)]2 
-11.4 -alpha(Hpcs) 

(Note: Ploss has been decreased by 6 dB, corresponding to the percentage of time variance factor). 

) a-l)For Hpcs <= 9 (m): 

alpha (Hpcs) = [I.I*log(Fmhz)-0.7] * Hpcs-[1.56*log(Fmhz)-0.8] 

a-2) For 9 < Hpcs <=28: 
alpha(Hpcs = -3.53+2.68*Hpcs-0. I0I 7*Hpcs2+ l.52*(10"3)*Hpcs3 

a-3) For 28 < Hpcs <=60: 
alpha (Hpcs) = 25.49 + 19.92 * log (Hpcs/28) 

b) For Hpcs > 60(m) free space propagation is assumed and the propagation loss is calcualted as: 
Ploss= 32.45 + 20*log(d) + 20*log(Fmhz) 
3.3.4 Antenna Considerations in TS-TS Analysis 
Three antenna system parameters are required in TSIP TS-TS interference calculations: maximum antenna gain, 
antenna feeder system loss and antenna discrimination (considering polarization of interfering and victim channels). 

-The maximum antenna gain is obtained from the antenna subsidiary tables (see Annex B). The proposed 
pdf and environment contain the MICS antenna codes of the antennas used at the interfering and victim 
stations. With these codes the program finds the appropriate antenna subsidiary record. These tables have 
stored the maximum gain and antenna patterns (i.e. antenna gain, in dB, vs. angle with respect to the 
direction of maximum gain, in degrees, for the different polarization's). 

TSIP Reference Manual 3.3 -13 Fall 1996 


The antenna feeder system loss is part of the antenna record, of the proposed pdf and environment. It is 

subdivided into Transmit and Receive Antenna feeder system losses. In the transmit direction it is called 
afsltx I and afsltx2, for the main and diversity transmitters respectively and in the receive direction it is 
caJled afslrxl, afslrx2 and afslrx3, for the main diversity I and diversity 2 receivers respectively. In both 
cases the aJlowable maximum value is 99.9 dB and the default value is OdB. 

The antenna discrimination is a function of the antenna pattern, considering polarization of victim and 
interfering channels, and the angle between interfering and victim antenna main beam directions. TSIP 
calculates first the "discrimination angles". For the interfering station this is the angle between the 
direction of maximum gain of the interfering antenna and the direction from the interfering to the victim 
station. For the victim station, it is the angle between the direction of maximum gain of the victim antenna 
and the direction from the victim station to the interfering station. With these discrimination angles and the 
appropriate antenna subsidiary tables (i.e. antenna patterns considering whether the channels are co-polar 
or cross-polar), the program calculates by linear interpolation the antenna gain of the interfering antenna in 
the.direction of the victim station, and the gain of the victini antenna in the direction of the interfering 
station. 

Antenna Discrimination in TS-TS Analysis 

Total antenna discrimination is the worst case (i.e. lowest discrimination) combination of discrimination taking 
polarization into account. The worst case is determined as foJlows: 

Desired Interfering 
Antenna Antenna 

H copolar H copolar least value is 

0

V copolar V copolar total copolar 

least value is 

H copolar V crosspolar 

total worst case 
polarization 

H crosspolar Vcopolar least value is discrimination 

V copolar H crosspolar total crosspolar 
V crosspolar H copolar 

For antennas other than passive reflectors, the antenna discriminations are arrived at by interpolation in the antenna 
data found in the antenna subsidiary tables, at the off-axis angle of the interfering ray. If the antenna or its crossreference 
is not found in the subsidiary tables, default antenna, "WORST TS", is used. 

3.3.4.2 Passive reflectors in TS-TS Analysis 
The TS-TS program can handle links involving passive reflectors. For a passive reflector the power levels are 
calculated using a special MICS routine. 
The passive reflector discrimination and beamwidth are calculated as foJlows: 
The dimensions of a passive reflector are determined by the antenna code used. The first three characters are the 

height, and characters 4 through 6 are the width. 
If the third and sixth characters are 'F', then characters I -2 and 4 -5 are eacH two-digit dimensions in feet. IfaJl 6 

characters are numeric, however, the dimensions are in tenths of a meter. 

0 

Fall 1996 3.3 -14 TSIP Reference Manual 


TSIP searches for the two opposite legs on the passive. It is assumed that, for each call sign, there is only one 
passive reflector, and that it can have a multiplicity of links which, however, must lie on one or the other of two 
azimuths. Ifthese two legs cannot be found, the passive station is skipped and an error message is written out. 

The included angle between the two legs is determined and the passive far-field gain is computed as follows: 

PGAIN=20 log (EFAREA) + 40 log (frequency)-77.32344 

Where: 

PGAIN: passive reflector gain, in dBi 

EFAREA: effective area. Is the passive height times width times the cosine ofhalfthe included angle, in m2. 
frequency is in MHz. 

The passive discrimination at off-axis angle OA is: 

DISC=20 log (EFFWID) + 20 log (frequency)+ 20 log (sin (OA)) -39.5995; 

where EFFWID is the passive width times the cosine of half the included angle. DISC is limited to PGAIN/2. The 
resulting value is used for both copolar and crosspolar discriminations. 

The passive beamwidth is computed from: 

ABW = 134.88734/(EFFWID x frequency). 

) ABW is limited to 57.295779 degrees. 

3.3.5 Equipment Frequency Stability in TS-TS Analysis 
Actual frequency separation. between interfering transmitter and victim receiver carriers is corrected by TSIP, during 

interference calculations, by the corresponding equipment frequency stabilities. The equipment frequency stabilities 

are stored in the Equipment Subsidiary Table, under the specific equipment codes. 

Frequency stability factors are stored iii percentage in MICS. The default value is 0.05%. 

Actual frequency drifting is calculated, in TSIP, by multiplying the frequency stability factor (value stored in the 

equipment subsidiary table divided by 100%) times the midband frequency. Finally, the actual frequency 

separation, fs, is calculated as: 

fs: IfWN -fIN I± (Sw fWB + SI fNI)/100 
fwN: nominal frequency, wanted signal 
fIN: nominal frequency, interfering signal 
Sw: frequency stability factor, wanted signal, in % 
SI: frequency stability factor, interfering signal, in % 
fwB: midband frequency, wanted signal 
flB: midband frequency, interfering signal. 

As the maximum total frequency drifting is added to and subtracted from the nominal frequency separation, a lower 

limit (fSLO) and an upper limit (fSHI) result. The required I, or C/I, value obtained by TSIP from the CTX table, is 

the worst value in the frequency range between fSLO and fSHI.

SELECTION OF STATIONS FOR INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS IN TS-TS AND TS-ES 

Radio stations in MICS are submitted to interference analysis in pairs. One ofthe stations of each pair is taken from 
the file under study and the other from the specified environment . Both files are determined by the user ( according 
to the specified TSIP parameter file). Once the pdf and environment are specified, station pairs are selected for 
further analysis if they meet all the following basic criteria: 

-call sign 
-operator's code 
-coordination distance 
-frequency band 
country 

3.2.1 Interference Analysis and can Sign 
A pair of stations can be submitted to analysis only if the call signs of the two ends of the microwave links are 
different. That means that the program will not analyze a link against itself. 

3.2.2 Interference Ana1vsis and Operator's Code 
As it is explained in Section 2, the user can select the operator codes to execute TSIP either in plan or in protect 
mode. 

In PLAN mode the user will run his or her file against all operators in the environment. 

In PROTECT mode only those stations in the environment which are identified as the user's own will be 
considered vs. all stations which are not user's own in the pdf (by inputting the operator codes in the 
parameter file the user identifies which operator codes are to be considered the user's "own" in the 
analysis). 

3.2.3 Interference Analysis and Coordination Distance 
Station pairs are submitted to analysis only if the distance separating the two stations is equal or less than a given 
coordination distance. The user has the option of specifying that distance. 

For terrestrial stations the user can specify any value up to 500 km. Ifno value is specified the program will use 
200km. 

For earth stations the user has to specify two distances: the coordination distance assuming tropospheric 
propagation and the coordination distance assuming precipitation scatter. For both distances the user can select any 
number up to 999 km. Default value is 500 km. 

The coordination distance must be used with judgement. Many factors, e.g. frequency band, site altitude, etc., may 
determine potential interference between two sites. If the user has no instructions from the design engineer TSIP 
default values should be used.

3.2.4 Interference Analysis and Frequency Band 
0 

Station pairs are submitted to analysis only iftbey have at least one frequency band in common, or a pair of adjacent 
frequency bands, as defined by tbe band adjacency codes in tbe band subsidiary table. 

Eitber in tbe same or in adjacent bands, TSIP is set at tbis moment to analyze up to a maximum frequency 
separation of 300 MHz (it is planned to give tbe user tbe option to select tbe maximum frequency separation in tbe 
future). 

. 3.2.5 Interference Analysis and Countzy 

The TSIP parameter-file creation screen allows tbe user to select Canadian sites only, US sites only or Canadian and 
us sites. If, for example, tbe user selects Canadian stations only, TSIP will not pass to analysis any station located in 
tbe US.

Interference Analysis 

INTRODUCTION 

The main program used for performing interference analysis in MICS is the Terrestrial and Space Interference 
Program (TSIP). 

3.0 

3.01 Functions ofTSIP 
TSIP can be used for performing the following functions: 

a) Analysis ofinterference among terrestrial microwave radio-relay systems. 
b) Analysis ofmicrowave interference between terrestrial radio-relay stations and fixed-satellite earth stations. 
c) Analysis of the possibility of intersection between terrestrial radio relay links and the geostationary satellite 
orbit. 
TSIP is set up to permit combinations ofthese functions to be invoked in a single run. 

) 

3.02 TSIP Parameter File 
TSIP is executed by submitting a "TSIP Parameter File" 

The TSIP Parameter file is in fact a command file which controls the way TSIP is executed. The commands in this 
file are a reflection of the options selected by the user at the time of creating the parameter file. The creation of a 
TSIP Parameter File is discussed in detail in Paragraphs 3.3.0 and 3.4.2 ofthis manual. 

3.03 PDF Input File in TSIP 
Each TSIP job analyzes the interference possibilities of one, and only one, file of microwave station data, which is 

taken to be the "unknown" microwave station data, versus several known or assumed "environments". The user can 

set these up by the appropriate commands to TSIP. 

The "unknown" pdf file is prepared by the user before running TSIP, by creating a pdf and submitting it to the 
analysis ofthe input data validation program. Once the pdfhas been validated, it can be used as input file to TSIP. 

TSIP Reference Manual 3.0-1 Summer1995 


3.04 Environments in TSIP 
0 

The "environments" against which the pdf is to be analyzed can be chosen by the user from among the following 
categories: 

a) The geostationary satellite orbit (for TS files only) 
b) Intra-system interference in the unknown file (for TS files only) 
c) TheTSMDB 
d) The ES MDB (for TS files only) 
e) Other pdfs 
The geostationary satellite orbit is defined implicitly in the mathematics of the TSORB branches of TSIP. It is 
assumed that satellites can be located anywhere in the orbit, and no account is taken of actual satellite locations. 

The other environments are defined by station data files that are in pdf format.

3.1 

FREQUENCY -SENSITIVE INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS OPTIONS 

There are three different frequency-sensitive interference analysis options in TSIP TS-TS: 

Band, Channel and Plan Analysis. 

In TSIP TS-ES analysis the options are Band and Channel, since there are no frequency plans in the ES PDF. 

3.1.1 Band Analysis 
Band analysis is a worst-case interference analysis. It is intended for the guidance of system designers in the early 
stages of system layout. It is a preliminary step that can aid the designer in the selection of sites, frequency band, 
frequency plan, polarizations, type of antenna, transmitter powers required, traffic types and equipment types for a 
projected system. When all these have been selected a P/C analysis can be performed to prove in the design. 

In Band analysis the stations are assumed to operate on any frequency within their respective frequency bands, 
using any traffic or equipment. The carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I) calculated under these assumptions is checked 
against a worst-case requirement. 

No matter which frequency-sensitive analysis option is chosen by the user, the program always performs a Band 
analysis on every pair of stations. 

) 
) 
In the TS-TS case, if the option selected is Band analysis, all cases which do not meet preset requirements will be 
reported. Ifthe option selected is other than Band, no reporting takes place at the Band analysis level. 

3.1.2 Channel Analysis 
In Channel analysis the stations are assumed to be using the frequencies, power levels, traffic types and equipment's 
defined in their respective channel records. Calculated C/l's or I levels are compared to requirements obtained from 
pertinent CTX tables. 

When the selected analysis mode is Channel, all combinations of stations are first subjected to Band analysis. Those 
interference cases which do not meet requirements in Band analysis are subjected to Channel analysis. 

Channel analysis is useful for determining whether a channel will interfore with other channels that exist or are 
currently planned. 

In TSIP Channel analysis, the user has the option to select active or planned channels, via the channel status code. 
Note that the status code(s) selected refer to the MDB and not to the PDF. For example; if the user selects status 
codes 4 and 5, TSIP will select only those MDB channels whose status codes are 4 or 5, regardless of the status 
codes ofthe channels in the PDF. 

TSIP Reference Manual 3.1-1 Fall 1996 


3.1.3 Plan Analysis 
Plan analysis is similar to channel analysis in terms of the parameters used in the analysis, e.g. power levels, traffic 
0 

types, equipments, etc. The difference is that in the PDF submitted to analysis, the user needs to enter only one 
channel record (for the same pair of stations, frequency band and antenna) and the desired frequency plan. If the 
user submits this file to interference analysis in Plan mode, TSIP will analyze all the channels belonging to the 
frequency plan indicated In the PDF. The_.parameters of the channel records (not included in the PDF) will be those 
ofthe first channel record having the same keys (i.e. local and remote can signs, antenna number and frequency 
band). Note that in this case the "Plan mode refers to the PDF. TSIP will analyze the PDF channels against existing 
channel records in the MDB.

Interference Calculation Modes 

2.0 GENERAL 
Microwave frequency coordination procedures in Canada are governed by regulations of the Federal Government, 
in particular Industry Canada. Readers unfamiliar with these regulations are referred to the FCSA Frequency 
Coordination Procedures Manual. 

In general, coordination becomes necessary in two circumstances (these are called 'PLAN' and 'PROTECT' in 
MICS): 

PLAN When an FCSA member intends to establish a new microwave facility, or to make changes to an 
existing facility, the member is interested in the interference that will be caused by the planned 
facility into the existing environment of his/her own and other stations, and the interference that 
will result into his/her planned facility from the environment. 

PROTECT -After an FCSA member has established microwave facilities, he/she is interested in the 
additional interference that may result into those facilities as a result of the proposals of other 
organizations for new or revised facilities in the same general area. 

0 

Whether under PLAN or PROTECT, interference can be categorized as: 

Between two terrestrial microwave stations. 
Between a terrestrial microwave station and an earth station. 
Between a terrestrial microwave station and a satellite station. 

At the present time, MICS does not treat interference between terrestrial and/or earth stations, on one hand, and 
other radio and non-radio services on the other.

"Plan" Mode.Procedure . I 


"PLAN" MODE PROCEDURE 

2.1 

2.1.1 General 
This procedure applies to cases where an FCSA member plans to establish new microwave facilities or to modify 
existing facilities 

In this procedure, the "proposing" member company is called "Company A". 

In summary, this procedure involves: 

a) Design ofproposal by Company A (using PDF Functions as necessary and convenient). 
b) Preparation or modification ifrequired of a data file ofthe proposal (in PDF format). 
c) Processing the PDF through the validation program for error checking and to add any relevant MDB 
(Microwave Database) data. 
d) Performing interference calculations on the, PDF, using TSIP in Plan Mode. 
e) Transferring the PDF to the users' coordination directory for MDB posting when "Company A" is ready 
to proceed with frequency coordination. 
f) Intercompany coordination and resolution of differences. 
g) Correction of data during and after licensing and construction. If changes occur during licensing or 
construction return to step b. 
2.1.2 Interference Analysis in PLAN Mode 
) After creating the PDF, Company A should now execute an interference analysis (using the Terrestrial and Space 
Interference Program, TSIP) in PLAN mode to check this PDF against, e.g. itself (intra), the terrestrial station MDB, 
the earth station MDB, the geostationary orbit, and other current PDF that may exist in Company A's private tables 
that have not already been posted to the MDB by FCSA. 

Program TSIP will analyze the effects ofthe new PDF into the environment and from the environment into the PDF. 

To execute TSIP in PLAN mode the user has to select "ALL" in the "Select Environment sites" window ofthe TSIP 
Parameter File. "ALL EXCEPT SELF" could also be selected if the user has already checked the file against his or 
her own company data.

2.2 "PROTECT" MODE PROCEDURE 
0 

2.2.1 Genera] 
This procedure applies to cases where an FCSA member (called "Company B" in this procedure) wishes to ascertain 
whether a new or changed microwave installation belonging to another company ( called "Company A" in this 
procedure) will cause harmful interference into Company B's existing or proposed stations. 

Company B may need to protect: 

Its own existing stations in the terrestrial MDB. 
Its own existing stations in the earth station MDB. 
Its proposed stations that are in PDF's in its own private tables. 

Different procedures apply depending on whether or not Company A is also an FCSA member. 

a) IfCompany A is also an FCSA member, this procedure involves: 
(i) Review of Company A's interference analysis results by Company B (Optional). 
(ii) Transfer ofCompany's A PDF to Company's B directory. 
(iii) Execution of an interference analysis in Protect mode by Company B to check any existing 
system or files for the possibility of interference. 
(iv) Resolution of differences. 
b) IfCompany A is not an FCSA member, this procedure involves: 
0

(i) Preparation of a PDF ofCompany A's proposal by Company B. 
(ii) Transferring the PDF to FCSA for posting to the MDB. 
(iii) Execution of an interference analysis in Protect mode by Company B, to check the Company A 
PDF against the MDB and any private Company's B files. 
(iv) Resolution ofdifferences. 
2.2.2 Interference Analysis io PROTECT Mode 
In PROTECT mode Company B can select (by selecting OPERATOR CODE in the TSIP Parameter File, followed 
by his or her own company OPER Code) those stations considered its "own" . .In fact, the user can select up to fifty 
"ownoper" codes which will be identified as his/her "own" during the analysis. 

The TSIP program, in PROT mode, will select from the environment indicated by the user all those stations which 
are considered user's own, and will analyze them against all those stations in the new "unknown" PDF file which 

are not considered user's own. 

The interference analysis will consider the effects ofthe PDF stations into the user's stations and the effects ofthe 
user's station into the PDF's stations.

Information Storage and Retrieval 

1.0 GENERAL 
Radio Systems Infonnation in the Microwave Infonnation and Coordination System {MICS) is stored in databases 
(DB's). The data required to perfonn frequency Coordination analysis is stored in the microwave database (mdb ). 
The mdb is divided into tables, and the microwave station data is stored in primary (pdf)) and subsidiary (sdf) data 
tables. Note that pdfand sdf are used as abbreviations (indicating files) because the tables are nonnally "exported" 
to text files, and the user nonnally prints these files. 

The database management system used by MICS is Ingres, which is a relational database system.

MDBTables> I 


I.I MDBTABLES 
The MDB contains information of Canadian and USA microwave systems operating at frequencies above 700 MHz. 

I.I.I Primary Pata Tables 
Primary data tables contain detailed information on terrestrial and earth stations (i.e. latitude and longitude of the 
site, frequencies employed, equipment employed, etc.) 

Terrestrial station primary data tables have in general a one-to-one correspondence with station call signs. That is, a 
particular call sign will retrieve a set of data tables specific to that call sign. These data tables contain the 
information of the station itself as well as all the station's links (including antennas, channels, etc.) In the case of 
earth stations, the one-to-one correspondence is between earth station and location code. 

The microwave primary data is stored in 3 main tables; 

-mt_site, which contains all site records; 
-mt_ ante, which contains all antenna records, and 
-mt_ chan, which contains all channel records. 

For earth stations the tables in the MDB are the following: 

the "me"_site table, which contains all site records; 
the "me"_ante table, which contains all antenna records; 
the "me"_azim table, which contains all azimuth records, and 

-the "me"_ chan table, which contains all channel records. 

The MICS programs, whenever required, access automatically the appropriate table, without user intervention. 

1.1.2 Subsidiary Data Tables 
The subsidiary data tables are not associated to any station in particular. They contain descriptive information and 
numerical data used in interference calculations and record keeping. The following are the subsidiary data tables: 

sd_antd, sd _ante, Antenna information, discrimination, and description 
sd_anty 
sd band Frequency bands and band adjacency information. 
sd_eqpt Equipment description. 
sd_ctx, sd_ctxd Interference objectives tables. 
sd_note Notes table. 
-sd_oper, sd_ocoo -Information on-operating and coordinating companies. 
sd_plan, sd_plnd Frequency plans. 
sd_rout Information on routes.

1.1.3 Admjnjstratjon ofthe MDB 
The administration of the mdb, resides in the FCSA central staff group. Within this group there is a Database 
Administrator (DBA) and the DBA is currently the only one who can introduce changes into the databases. This is 
valid forboth, the primary and most of the subsidiary information in the database. 

For updating the database, the DBA uses manual checks, followed by the validation program, for primary and 
subsidiary data (pdf and sdf VALIDA TE), which is the same program the members use, and then the MDB update 
program (called UPDATE in MICS), which posts primary and subsidiary information to the appropriate tables. 
Only the DBA is allowed to use update.

1.2 

DIRECTORIES AND FILES 

All data in the MICS computer system, with the exception of data contained in databases, are stored in files. Files 
are grouped together in directories. Directories can be classified in different types, according to the privileges or 
access restrictions associated with them. 

There are four different privileges that a user may have over a directory or a file: 

a) Read -the right to examine, list, or copy a file or files on a disk or tape volume. 
b) Write -the right to modify a file or to write files on a disk or tape volume. 
c) Execute -the right to execute files that contain executable program images. 
d) Delete -the right to delete the file or files on a disk or tape volume. 
1.2.1 Private and Coordination Directories 
Private Directories -All MICS users have their own private directories, assigned under their users' 
identification code (UIC). The files within a private directory can be accessed only 
by the owner of that directory and the owner can exert all four privileges on the 
files it contains. 

Coordination Directory -All users have a "coordination" directory. These directories are accessible to all 
other users. They are used for example, to transfer a data file from the user private 
directory, for other users to copy it and execute their coordination studies. 

FCSA Public Directories: These are directories accessible to all users and are used by FCSA to transfer data to the 

users. 

1.2.2 Types ofFj]es 
Data Files -data files can be: 
i) DB update files 
ii) Execution report files 
iii) Command procedure files 
iv) Other data files 
J 

TSIP Reference Manual 1.2 -1 Summer1995 


i. DB update files -There are two types ofDB update files: Primary (sdf) and Subsidiary (sdf) files. 
-the pdf station data files are the basic input files for the primary database tables. They contain data which 
describes changes (i.e. additions, modification, deletions) that a user wants to introduce into the primary 
DB. 

-the sdf data files are the basic input to the subsidiary database tables. They contain data which describe 
changes ( additions, modification, deletions) that a user wants to introduce into the subsidiary tables. 

ii. Execution report files -The results of the execution of a program can be either listed to a file ( an execution 
report file) or written to the terminal. 
iii. Command procedure files -Files which contain instructions (commands) to the MICS system to perform certain 
actions. When a command procedure file is executed the instructions are performed.(For example the TSIP 
parameter file) 
iv. Other data files -Other data files may exist in the users' directories. For example as input to, or output from, 
auxiliary calculation programs.

RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION FROM THE DATABASE 

1.3 

Primary and subsidiary information can be retrieved from the mdb by using MICS programs. 

1.3.I Retrieval of Primary Data 
Primary data can be retrieved from the mdb by selecting the "Create PDF from MDB" option, under "PDF 
Functions." The user has serval culling options, to select that part of the database of his or her interest (e.g. by call 
sign, or by pair of call signs, etc.). For more details on how to operate these functions, see the PDF Functions 
section of the MICS User Guide. 

1.3.2 Retrieval of Subsidiary Data 
Subsidiary data can be retrieved from the sd tables by selecting the "Create SDF from SDB" option, under "SDF 
Functions", followed by the section ofthe particular table wanted by the user. 

The user has several culling options, which will depend on the particular table selected ( e.g. Antenna Code, or CTIC 
table, etc.). For more details or how to operate these functions, see the SDF Functions sections of the MICS User 
Guide. 

) 1.3.3 Retrieval ofPata Using Re.ports Options or Ingres 

Data can also be retrieved by selecting the "Reports" option in the MICS menu, or by going directly into Ingres. 
The "Create PDF from MDB" and "Create SDF for SDB" functions are more suitable for interference analysis, since 
they create the files in the format required by the interference analysis program (TSIP).

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
TI1e intent of this report is to provide a presentation on the general principles used in computing 
interference objectives for dual conversion receiver and a guideline for MICS users to be included in FCSA 
documentation. This supplements the CTX instructions contained in the TSIP Reference Manual. 

The CTXDOA TD computer program available for use in the MICS computer system is to be used as the 
basic tool in computation ofthe interference objectives. 

2.0 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
To characterize a victim dataset for a radio receiver, three of the parameters that the CTX program 
requires are the receiver's Intermediate Frequency (IF), RF filter response at ± IF away from the carrier or 
Specific IF Response Factor, and RF filter response at ± 2 ' IF away from the carrier or Specific 2 ' IF 
Response Factor. These Specific Response Factors can be extracted from Tiireshold / Continuous Wave 
Interference Curve, or Susceptibility to Continuous Wave Interference Curve. 

As the name implies, dual conversion receiver has two intermediate frequency stages in cascade and this 
makes the coding of victinl file more complicated ie. which IF to consider? 

3.0 REVIEW OF VICTIM DATASET PARAMETERS 
The format for the digital Victim Dataset is given in the TSIP Reference Manual and it is given below for

AI70 -RF filter ·response (dB) at carrier frequency shifted by the IF frequency XIF 

which can be found from the RF filter curve (Note 2) 
AIJ40 -RF filter response (dB) at carrier frequency shifted by twice the intermediate 
frequency 2XIF which can be found using the RF filter attenuation curve (Note 2) 
THDCRIT -Threshold Degradation due to Interference of which a value of either I dB or 3dB 
is assumed. Refer to the CTX Instructional Report for more detail 
(fi,ai) -where i=l,2,...24 are the Frequency Versus Frequency Response Data Point Pairs 
and are obtained from susceptibility to continuous wave interference curves. Zeros 
may be used for null data to complete the dataset 
Note I: If a user chooses a default selectivity, the program ,viii still look for the first two lines in 
the dataset. The digital victim dataset name is limited to 6 alphanumeric characters. Also, 
the selectivity data at frequencies above those provided by the supplier must be truncated 
to 110 dB starting 0.1 l'vIHz above the highest frequency given in the specifications to a 
frequency of 400 l'vIH.z. 
Note 2: The program uses AI70 and AI140 as default values to approximate the IF and Image 
response of the radio. It is preferred to use the SPECIFIC IF RESPONSE FACTOR and 
the SPECIFIC IMAGE RESPONSE FACTOR derived from the T/I or C/I curves. It is 
important to note that AI70 and AI 140 are by definition not the same as the Specific IF 
Response Factor and Specific Image Response Factor. AI70 and AIJ40 are based on the 
response of the RF filter alone. The Specific Factors are based on the overall response of 
the radio. The CTXDOATD program adds 20 dB to AI70 for the mixer attenuation to 
derive the Specific IF Response Factor. 
C) 
--RF 
Filter Response and Threshold / Continuous Wave Interference Susceptibility Curves are available 
within the manufacturer's specifications. Susceptibility to CW / Modulated Interference Data is required to 
determine the specific IF and image response factors and to create the victim dataset.

are descripted in the following sections. 

4.1 Image Response 
Image response is the receiver's response to a mixing phenomenon where an interference frequency is mixed 
with the local oscillator (LO) to produce an interference spectrum similar to the intermediate frequency at 
the intermediate frequency (IF) stage. For receivers with a single 1F stage, the interference frequency is F, 
± 2 IF (where F, denotes the victim receive RF frequency), and the image response is limited by the RF 
filter selectivity at that frequency. On the other hand, image response for dual conversion receivers is more 
complex due to the additional IF stage.

According to Case Studies 1 through 4 in Appendix 1, the frequencies that can produce an interference () 
spectrum at the second Intermediate frequency (IF2) are: 

L0 1 < Fe and L02 > IF1 I LO,< Fe and L02 < IF, L01 > Fe and L02 > IF 1 I L01 > Fe and L02 < IF1

V) F, -(IF, -IF,) F, + (IF, -IF2)

where IF1 is the first intermediate frequency, LO, is the first local oscillator frequency, and LO2 is the 
second local oscillator frequency. 

i) When mixed with LO1, an interference spectrum similar to IF1 at the IF 1 stage is produced. 
The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the RF filter response. 
ii) and iii) When mixed with LO1, an interference spectrum at the IF 1 stage is produced, which can be 
down converted by LO2• The second order product is an interference spectrum similar to 
IF2, thus interfering with IF2. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the 
combined response ofthe RF filter, and the first IF filter. 
iv) and v) When mixed with LO1, an interference spectrum similar to IF2 at the IF 1 stage is produced, 
which can be down converted by LO2• The fundamental product is an interference 
spectrum similar to IF2 at the IF2 stage. The receiver response at this frequency is 
dependent on the combined response of the RF filter, the first IF filter, and the second 
mixer efficiency.

receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the RF filter response. 
ii) and iii) When mixed with LO1, a 177.8 MHz interference spectrum is produced at the IF1 stage. 
The second mixer converts this 177.8 MHz interference spectrum into a 21.4 MHz 
interference spectrum at the IF2 stage. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent 
on the combined response of the RF filter, and the first IF filter. 
iv) and v) When mixed with LO,, a 21.4 MHz interference spectrum is produced at the IF, stage. 
The fundamental product with LO2 is a 21.4 MHz interference spectrum at the IF2 stage.

filter, the first IF filter, and the second mixer efficiency. 

4.2 IF Response 
IF spurious response is the receiver's response to a second order distortion product that can create an 
interference spectrum at IF frequency, with a bandwidth equal to the sum of the interferer and victim 
bandwidths (ie. convolution of the interferer and victim PSD). The generated second order energy depends 
mainly on the receiverfront end design and will be controlled ifthe energy at 'IF' response frequency can be 
maintained 10 -20 dB below the receiver overload point as measured at the receiver RF input port.

In the case ofreceivers with a single IF stage, the IF response depends on the sum ofthe RF filter response 
at F, ± IF, and 20 dB. For dual conversion receivers, there are frequencies other than F, ± IF that can 
produce an interference spectrum at the IF frequencies due to the additional IF stage. According to Case 
Studies I through 4 in Appendix 1, the possible frequencies which can interfere with the IF frequencies are 
as follow: 

L01 < Fe and L02 > IF1 I L01 < Fe and L02 < IF1 I L01 > Fe and L02 > IF1 I L01 > Fe and L02 < IF1 
vi) Fe± IF1 
vii) Fe± IF2 
viii) F, ± (LO2+ IF2) I F, ±(LO,· IF2) I F, ±(LO,+ IF2) I F,± (LO2-IF2) 

Table 3Poss1ble IF response frequencies for dual conversion receiver. 

vi) Both F, and F, ± IF1 get into the first mixer. A second order distortion product similar to IF1 is 
generated at the IFI stage, thus interfering with IF1• The receiver response at this frequency is 
dependent on the combined response ofthe RF filter and first mixer efficiency. 
vii) Both F, and F, ± IF2 get into the first mixer. A second order distortion product similar to IF2 is 
generated at the IF1 stage. Again, it is mixed with LO2 and produces a fundamental product similar 
to IF2, thus interfering with IF2. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the 
combined response ofthe RF filter, first IF filter, and first and second mixer efficiencies. 
viii) Either F, ± (LO2 + IF2) or F, ± (LO2 -IF2), and Fe get into the first mixer. A second order 
distortion product either (LO2 + IF2) or (LO2 -IF2) respectively is generated at the IF1 stage. 
Again, it is mixed with LO2 and produces a second order product similar to IF2, thus interfering 
with IF2• The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response of the RF 
filter, first IF filter, and first mixer efficiency.

5.0 CTXDOATD CTX DATASET GENERATION PROGRAM 
In the CTX model, the image response is accounted for by replicating a double-sided version of the main 
CTX objective shifted in frequency by 2 IF and by increasing the interference objective by an amount equal 
to the RF filter response (attenuation) at frequency F, ± 2 IF. A comparison is then made between the main 
interference objective and the replicated objective over the frequency range 2 IF± IF/2. 

J 

CTX GENERATION FOR DUAL CONVERSION RECEIVERS Page 7 


96 09 20 Network Standard 

The IF response is accounted for by replicating the main co-channel objective shifted in frequency by IF 
from the centre frequency and by increasing the interference objective by an amount equal to the sum of 20 
dB plus the RF filter response (attenuation) at the frequency shifted by F, ± IF. A comparison is made 
between the main co-channel objective and the replicated response over the frequency range IF ± IF/2. The 
worst objective is selected. 
' ( 
) 
_, 
In the victim file, it is prefered to use the Specific IF Response Factor and the Specific Image Response 
Factor derived from the T/1 or C/1 curves. In the program, the Specific IF Response Factor is assumed to 
be 20 dB higher than the RF filter attenuation at F, ± IF, therefore the Specific IF Response Factor can be 
input into the victim file after reducing it by 20 dB. 
For more indepth explanation on the CTX model, refer to the CTX instructions in the TSIP Reference 
Manual. 
6.0 DATASETS FOR DUAL CONVERSION DIGITAL RADIO RECEIVER 
In the CTX model image and IF responses are based on the replicated main co-channel response shifted by 
the corresponding frequencies and attenuated to the corresponding level. Therefore, the calculations for 
image response and IF response are the same except for the shift in frequency and the level of attenuation. 
In these calculations, the image and IF responses are derived by comparing the main objective with the 
replicated objective and selecting the worst objective. 
The separations amongst the possible receiver spurious response frequencies are relatively large when 
compared to the channel bandwidth, therefore the responses at these frequencies can be processed 
individually provided the proper Specific Factors are used. By comparing and selecting the worst objective 
over these frequency ranges, a composite CTX curve is produced for dual conversion receiver.

The CTXDOATD program was executed with the interferer dataset in Section 6.1 against the following 
five victim datasets. The resulted interference objectives are plotted in Figures 6 to 10. 

6.3 Equipment # I CTX (composite) Curve Generation 
By comparing and selecting the worst objective over the entire frequency range on Figures 6 to I 0, a 
composite CTX curve is produced for Equipment #1, and it is shO\m on Figure 11. 

The CTXDOATD program output is stored in a text file. To produce a composite CTX dataset for dual 
conversion receiver, a spread sheet program such as EXCEL, LOTUS, or SYMPHONY is required. 

Q 
EXCEL was used to produce the Equipment # I dataset, . The CTXDOA TD output files were downloaded 
from the MICS computer. These text files were imported into an EXCEL spread sheet. Figure 5 shows a 
sample ofthe EXCEL spread sheet showing the objectives for one ofthe IF frequencies. 

The output file contains interference objectives for up to 300 MHz, and only a portion of the output file is 
shown in Figure 5. Column A shows the output of the CTXDOATD program. To extract the information 
from Column A, two EXCEL spread sheet functions are used, and they are: 

i) MID(cell,start_num,num_chars) 
e.g., MID(AI0,3,6) 
This function extracts substring ofthe cell specified. In the example, the returned string is" 0.30". 
For Column B in Row 10, the frequency separation, MID(AI0,3,6) is used. Column C, the 
interference objective, MID(a!0,13,7) is used. 
ii) V ALUE(text) 
e.g., VALUE(MID(AI0,3,6)) 
This function converts the text argument to number. In the example, the returned number is 0.3. 
To produce a composite CTX dataset with the worst case interference objective at each frequency 
separation for the Image Response and IF Response frequencies, the MIN function is used: 

iii) MIN( cell_start:cell_ end), or MIN( celll ,ce112,cell3,cell4, ... ) 
e.g., MIN(Al:Fl) 
CTX GENERATION FOR DUAL CONVERSION RECEIVERS Page 12 


96 09 20 Network Standard 

When specified as a range, this function returns the minimum value of the range of cells specified. 

On the other hand, if individual cells are identified, it returns the minimum value of the cells 

specified. In the case ofthe example, it returns the minimum value ofthe cells Al to F 1. 

For further information on the above functions, see the User's Manual ofthe spread sheet program.

6.4 Conclusion and Recommendation 
In figure 11, the composite CTX curve for Equipment # I taking into account of all possible spurious responses 
due to the dual conversion receiver is a very conservative approach. However, to generate such type of composite 
curve is very cumbersome and is not very practical. 

As it is realized that many conservative assumptions have been made to the current CTX model such as the IF 
response is based on replicating the main co-channel objective shifted in frequency by IF from the centre 
frequency and increasing the interference objective by adding 20 dB to the RF filter response (attenuation) at the 
frequency shifted by F, ± IF or receiver selectivity attenuation remains 11 0dB at f(max) plus 0.1 MHz entirely to 
400 MHz for the purpose of extrapolation where f(ma'<) is the maximum frequenc}' provided in a supplier's 

curve. 

Therefore, for the sake of simplicity and being practical, it is recommended that the most conservative values for 
AI70 and AI 140 be used by selecting only between the first IF frequency and the second IF frequency for deriving 
specific IF and Image response factors from either T/I or susceptibility to CW interference or RF receiver 

selectivity curves. 

In this case, the (AI70, AI140) at 21.4 MHz having (66.3, 76) is found to be more conservative than the one at 
135 MHz which is (83, 95). The corresponding CTX curve using (AI70, AI140)=(66.3, 76) for Equipment #1 
(interferer) into Equipment #1 (victim) is in fact the curve generated in fig. 6. In summary, in opposition to the 
composite curve in figure! I which is combining the worst CTX calculated values among figures 6, 7, 8, 9 and 
I0, the CTX curve in figure 6 can be applied with ma'<illlum practical CTIC values for interference analysis as 
well as a much less time effort for dual conversion receiver CTX curve generation.

carrier given in Table 6. If it is not possible, values at these frequencies will be required. 
The T /I or susceptibility to CW data are preferred to be measured values. 

Note 3: It is recommended that Specific Response Factors derived from T/1 or Susceptibility curve 
be used instead of the factors from RF Filter Response Curve since they contain the 
combined RF, IF, and Baseband filter data as well as the mixer efficiencies.

B.1 

ANTENNA SUBSIDIARY TABLES 

B.1.1 Deseription 
The sd ante and scl_antd tables contain all the necessary information on antenna radiation parameters and 
discrimination patterns, for interference computations. the tables also contain general information used to describe 
the antenna. The records are keyed on the antenna code which is also used in the primary tables. 

The sd_anty subsidiary table contains the definitions of the antenna type codes, which are used in the sd_ante table. 

B.1.2 Design Philosophy 
B.1.2.1 Relating the Antenna Code to the Manufacturers' Antenna Type 
A twelve alpha-numeric character antenna type code, which. is closely related to the manufacturer's antenna type 
description, is used to enable the user to identify the antenna without requiring his/her making reference to other 
documentation. 

B.1.2.2. Antenna Pattern Coding Method 
The inflection point method ofcoding antenna patterns has been used by FCSA for several years. 

) 
) 
However, there are some manufactures which provide electronically stored patterns at fix angular separation. Bbth 
types of patterns are acceptable to FCSA. 

The MICS programs require that the O degree and 180 degree points be part of the patterns. If there are points 
beyond 180 degrees, the 359.9 degrees points also mandatory. 

Antennas coded XXXXXXX%, where X is an alpha-numeric character, are reserved for passive reflectors. 

The block of antenna codes $XXXXXXX, where X is an alpha-numeric character, is reserved for internal use by 
each number (i.e. temporary antenna codes). FCSA will not record not issue patterns bearing codes in this in-house 
block. A user wishing to assign a temporary code to an antenna for internal use (e.g. while waiting for a code to 
approved) can use a code falling in this in-house block to run interference studies. It should be noted that the gain 
of the antenna must be specified in the last 3 character positions of the antenna code. Up to IO such codes may be 
specified. 

Antenna code requirements for parabolic and horn reflector type antennas 

a) If the entire manufacturer's type number can be inserted in the 12 spaces, then it should be, e.g. Pl271G 
coded as Pl2-71G. 
b) If the manufacturer's type number is more than 12 characters then eliminate· any information that does 
not affect the antenna pattern, e.g. UXHP12-35GEAB coded as UXHP1235GEAB. 
c) In the eases of asymmetrical antenna patterns there will be a code for the left pattern (feed form at the 
left side) and one code for the right pattern (feed form at the right side). The left hand pattern points 
will be inputted in the range of 180.1 to 359.9 degrees. 
TSIP Reference Manual B.1-1 Winter 1995 


d) A dual band dual polarization antenna will usually have eight antenna type patterns, four for each band 
of operation. Within each band a code would be required. 
e) Some antennas are based on a U.S. frequency band and some on a Canadian band at 4 GHz. The 
Canadian band is wider (lower in frequency). In order to accommodate this in the coding, the 
frequency band is prefixed with an A for American and C for Canadian in the antenna code. For 
example, SH I 0-C4V would indicate Canadian 4 GHz. 

B.1.3 Access and Maintenance of the Antenna Tables 
B.1.3.1. FCSA Maintenance of Antenna Subsidiary Tables 
These subsidiary tables can be accessed only by FCSA for maintenance purposes (add, delete or change of 

information within the tables) through the subsidiary data update program. These changes will be the result of 
requests initiated by members. 

B.1.3.2. Accessing Information from the Antenna Subsidiary Tables 
FCSA members may access these subsidiary tables in order to list information in specific format as required. See 
section 2 of the MICS User Guide. INGRES can also be used to obtain the information required. 

B.1.4. Antenna Flat File Example 
An example ofan antenna "Flat File" (i.e. antenna record in text format) is presented on Table B.1.4.

B.1.5 Antenna Plot File Example 
The radiation patterns of the same antenna presented in the example of B.1 .4, can be obtained in a different format: 

the "Antenna Plot File" (it is called plot file because it is separated·in columns, ready to be downloaded to a PC and 

. used as input file to a plotter). This file is presented on Table B.1.5. 

To obtain the antenna plot file the user has to select #6, "Reports", in the MICS main menu, followed by #5, 
"Plotting", in the Reports Menu (screen 6.0) and #3, "antenna Gain/Angle", in the Plotting Menu (screen 6.5). 

The antenna plot file consists of a heading and five columns. The heading contains the antenna.code, antenna gain 

in dB, and MICS antenna band code. 

The columns of the plot file are: 

Angle: Antenna discrimination angle, from center of main beam, in degrees.. 

) DCOV: Vertical co-polar (V-V) discrimination, in dB. 

DCOH: Horizontal co-polar (H-H) discrimination, in dB.

Note that the angle range -180 to Odegrees would correspond to the FCSA "left pattern", and Oto I80 degrees to 

the "right patter". Also the NSMA format includes the patterns in the vertical (elevation) plane. But in this 

particular case the points are not given (i.e. ELHl-1 0, ELI-IV 0, ELVV 0, ELVH 0. The number, 0 in this case, 

reefers to the number of points in the pattern. 

8.1.8 Special Antenna Tvpes 
There are three special antenna types in MICS: passive reflectors (billboard type), CCIR and periscope antenna 
types. These antenna types are identified by using special antenna codes. 
The radiation patterns of CCIR and passive reflectors are implicit in the MICS code, in closed form equations (not 

in table form, in the SDB, like all other antennas). 

Passive Reflectors 

Billboard type passive reflec_tor antenna codes have the following format: 

a) The first 3 characters are the passive height in decimeters, unless the third character is "F", 
which would indicate the height in given in feet. 

b) The fourth to sixth characters are the passive width in decimeters, unless the sixth characters is 
"F", which would indicate that the width is given in feet. 

c) The seventh character is a letter or number, to distinguish between difference passives of the 
same dimension. 

d) The eight character is "%" (this is mandatory), indicating this is a billboard type passive 
reflector, e.g. 023040A% is a 23x40 decimeter passive. 08Fl2A% and 08F\28% are two 8xl2 
foot passives. 

The passive reflector gains in calculated as follows: 

PGAIN = 20 log (EFAREA) + 40 log (frequency) -77.32344 

where: 

PGAIN: passive reflector gain in dBi 

EFARE: effective are in square meters. Is equal to the passive height times the passive width time 

the cosine of one half ofthe included angle. 
frequency: is the frequency in MHz. 

The off-axis passive reflector discrimination is given by: 

DISC= 20 log (EFFWID) + 20 log (frequency)+ 20 log sin (OA) -39.5995 

Winter 1995 B.1-8 TSIP Reference Manual 


where: 
DISC: passive reflector discrimination with respect to main direction of transmission, in dB. 
EFFWID: effective width, in meters. Passive width time the cosine of one half of the included angle. 
frequency: frequency, in MHz 
OA: off-angle, in degrees. Discrimination angle measured from the main direction of 

transmission.· 

The passive beamwidth is computed from: 

ABW = 134.88734/(EFFWID x frequency) 

where: 

ABW beamwidth, in degrees. ABW id limited to 57.295779 degrees 

EFFWlD and frequency are defined above. 

CCIR Type Antennas 

Earth station antennas whose patterns are given by CCIR re~ommendation 465-1 are assigned antenna codes of the 

following format: CClRXXYY, where XX is the Rx and YY is the Tx antenna gain, in dB. For example 

CCJR4442, would indicate that the main beam antenna gain of this antenna is 44(dBi) in the receiving direction and ) 42 (dBi) in the transmitting direction. 

The discrimination of a CCIR type antenna is given by: 

· DISC= 0(dB) '0,; OA ~l.O (degree) 

= AGAIN -32 + 25 log(OA) l .0<OA ,; 48.0 (degrees) 

= AGAIN +IO 48.0 < OA (degrees) 

where: 
DISC: antenna discrimination, in dB 
AGAIN: antenna maximum gain, in dBi 
OA: off-angle, in degrees. With respect to the center of the antenna main beam. 

TSIP Reference Manual B.l -9 Winter 1995 


Periscope Type Antennas 

The dimensions and spacing of periscope antennas are included in the antenna code. 

a) The first two characters are the diameter of the parabolic antenna in feet (F is the third 
character) or the diameter in meters (M is the third character). 
b) The fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh, characters are the narrow and wide dimensions respectively 
of the reflector. The dimensional unit must be consistent with that of the parabolic antenna (i.e. 
all feet or all meters). 

c) The eight character uniquely defines particular reflector/parabola combinations, e.g. as the 
separation and the shape of the reflector. Letters are assigned serially from A and have no 
particular meaning in themselves. 
Example: 

0SF1217A Periscope conibination of 8 ft diameter parabolic antenna with a 12 ft x 17 ft 

rectangular reflector with a spacing ranging from 120 to 300 ft. 

03M0406E Periscope combination of 3 meter diameter parabolic antenna with a 4m x 6m 
rectangular reflector with a spacing ranging from 40 to I00 meters. 

B.1.11 Antenna Inflection Point Coding Instructions 
The following instructions apply to the coding of microwave antenna patterns for use in MICS where the antenna 

0

pattern provided by the manufactures is in rectangular graph format. 

Background of antenna inflection :point method 

a) Microwave interference studies take into account thediscrimination due to the directivity of the 
antennas involved. The manufacturers of microwave antennas describe the directivity of their 

antennas (for interference calculation purposes) on 'Radio Pattern Envelops' which they will 

provide on request. Radiation pattern envelops may have a polar format; however, the majority 
of RPE's generated today are in rectangular format. 

b) The purpose of antenna coding is to translate each pattern into a list of numbers suitable for 
processing in a computer using the antenna input form described previously. A blank form is 
contained at the end of this subsection. 
c) A set of up to a maximum of 200 point has to be chosen fi-om each pattern so that, when 
straight lines are drawn between adjacent points, the actual pattern is on, or just below each 
straight line. 

Winter 1995 B.1 -10 TSIP Reference Manual 


Procedure and Requirements for Antenna Inflection Point Coding 

a) Internal procedures in each FCSA member company will determine when a radiation pattern 
envelope is to be encoded onto a coded antenna pattern form. 
b) Obtain the most recent issue of the radiation pattern envelopes appropriate for the make and model 
of the antenna to be encoded. When the antenna manufacture issues a radiation pattern envelope 
(RPE) it is unique in that it reflects either a new or revised pattern for the particular antenna. 
I) Radiation pattern envelopes are curves generally showing the worst discrimination to be 
expected as a function of off-axis angle. 
2) In some cases, radia_tion pattern envelopes will to be available and the only patterns available 
will be actual (or typical) radiation patterns. As long as the patterns are signed by the 
company submitting the antenna pattern, they will be accepted by the antenrm coordinators. In 
the case where no patterns exist, it will be the decision of the antenna coordinators to either 
reject the submission or cross-reference the antenna to a worst-case antenna of equivalent band 
and size. Usually, an actual or a typical pattern will be full of peaks and valleys. In such 
cases, form a radiation pattern envelope for each pattern by drawing a smooth curve, or series 
of straight line, enclosing all the peaks in the pattern. 
3) Make sure all the relevant sheets of each radiation pattern envelope are on hand. Some 
antennas require more than one sheet to fully describe their radiation pattern envelopes. 
4) Where both rectangular and polar plots are available, use the rectangular only. If only a polar 
plot is available then this polar plot must be converted to a suitable rectangular plot using ) graph paper. 
5) Where separate curves are given for guarante~d and typical radiation pattern envelopes, use 
the typical curve. 
6) Where the manufacture provides two distinct radiation pattern envelopes for the right and left 
feed orientation of an antenna such as an Andrew UHX-type the right hand pattern will be 
coded from Oto I 80° and the left hand pattern from I 80. I to 359.9 degrees. 
7) Where there are two distinct patterns for vertical into vertical and horizontal into horizontal 
such as some horn reflectors and some plane polarized antennas, these will be inputted to the 4 
discrimination columns of the antenna form. 
8) Dual band antennas will be ·treated as two separate antennas resulting in separate codes for 
each band. In most cases, the antenna manufacturer produces separate Radiation Pattern 
Envelopes for the two bands that the antenna operates over. In the case where the antenna 
manufacturer produces only one pattern for both bands, two antenna codes, one for each band 
are required and the same pattern will be used in both bands. 
c) For each radiation pattern envelope to be encoded, draw a series of straight lines to approximate the 
radiation pattern envelope. Beginning at angle = 0 degrees, draw a pencil line tangent to the 
pattern. Record the value of discrimination (dB) and angle in degrees that corresponds to where 
your pencil just deviates from the pattern, always recording the worst case value. Next, starting at 
the new angle, draw a second pencil line tangent to the pattern and record the discrimination and 
angle. This procedure is repeated until you reach the discrimination value that corresponds to angle 
= 180 degrees. Every time you draw a pencil line, your record a pair of values for angle (degrees) 
and discrimination (dB). There must never be more than 1.0 dB difference between you pencil line 
TSIP Reference Manual B.1-11 Winter 1995 


approximation and the radiation pattern envelope, and you straight lines must never go below the 
radiation pattern envelope. Whenever there is a change in the pattern, either from the copolar or 

crosspolar patter, a pair of discrimination values should be recorded. 

d) Verticals steps in the antenna pattern are catered to by offsetting one of the angles by 0.1 degree. 
For example, a vertical step in the antenna pattern from 60 dB to 5·3 dB at 175 degrees could be 
coded as follows: 
Angle (degrees) Discrimination (dB) 

115.0 60 
174.9 60 
175.0 53 
180.0 53 

e) If the number of points used exceeds 200 including 0 degrees, reduce the number of points to 200 
(including Odegrees) while still attempting to minimize the error. 
Note: In no case should the accuracy of main lobe representation or front-to-back ratio be 
sacrificed during the process of reducing the total number of points to 200 (including 0 
degrees). If this applies the MICS Technical Group representative should point this out 
when submitting the coded pattern to the antenna coordinators for review. 

B.1.12 Usage Notes 
If on any antenna code form you have used AXTYPE of I, 2, 8 or 9, then you must prepare another form for the 
cross referenced antenna. 

0 

Peak-to-RMS Factor of Antennas (ARMS) 

Since the antenna pattern codes are based on straight line envelopes, the actual discrimination at a particular angle, 
beyond the n1ain lobe, may actually be greater than the coded value. Accordingly, the following additional 
discrimination may be applied"by the MICS user when analyzing the results ofTSIP runs. 

Antenna Peak-to-RMS-Factor 

I horn 6 dB 
I parabolic 4 dB 
I delay lens 5 dB 

B.1.13 Antenna Coding Auxiliary Tables 
There are four auxiliary tables needed in the antenna coding process. All these tables are listed in the MICS User 
Guide. The tables are: 

• Antenna Standard Frequency Bands table, listed in section 2.1-7 of the MICS User Guide, 
• Antenna Type table, listed in section 2.1-8 of the MICS User Guide, 
• Antenna Cross-Reference Type table, listed in section 2.1-7 of the M!CS User Guide, 
• Antenna Manufacturer codes table, listed in section 2.1-8 of the MICS User Guide.

B.2 FREQUENCY BAND SUBSIDIARY TABLE 
B.2.1 Description 
The frequency band subsidiary table sd_band, is used to store information on frequency bands allocated for Fixed 
Services (point-to-point terrestrial and fixed satellite services). 

B.2.2 Design Philosophy 
Information stored in the band subsidiary table consists fo band frequency limits, band center frequency and band 
adjacency information in coded form. Links within the same band and in adjacent bands are considered in program 

TSIP for various calcualtions in interference analysis while links in other bands are eliminated. The band limits are 
used by program VALIDATE for error checking. 

B.2.3 Creating and Editing Band Subsidiary Files 
Band subsidiary files can be created or edited on screen (screen 2. l .2A, Frequency Band SDF Form). For a detailed 
discussion ofthis screen's parameters see section 2.1-12 ofthe MICS User Guide. 

Retrieval of an existing band for the SDB can also be done on screen (screen 2.2.2, Create SDF Frequency Band 
From SDB). The user enters the band code(s) he/she is interested on (screen 2.2.2.A), saves and executes this file 
on screen 2.2.2. 

) 
) 
From screen 2.2.2 the user can "Export" a band file to text file in his/her default directory. An example of a band 
file is presented on Table B.2.3.

B.2.4 Band Subsidiary Table Bandword 
To speed up TS!P culling process, the band codes within a station are mapped into "bandwords". The bandword is 
a 32 bit word where the band codes are mapped as follows: 

• take each distinct band code at a particular sit, 
• divide 2147483648 by 2", where n is equal to the band position number minus I, 
• sum the results. 
For example, station ABC123 has two bands: 11 and 12. 
Its bandword would be: 

2147483648/(zC11•
1l) 2097152 

2 ]47483648/(2('2-l)) =+ 1048576

INTERFERENCE OBJECTIVES SUBSIDIARY TABLES 

) B.3 

B.3.1 Description 
CTX are tables of interference objective curves stored according to lhe desired and interfering traffic types and the 
receiving equipment type. Interference requirements are stored in the sd_ctx and sd_ctxd tables. 

B.3.2 Analo° CTX's 
Curves have been drawn to represent the interference objective as a function of the frequency separation between 
the desired and interfering carriers for selected long haul and short haul cases. AII other cases of interference are 
cross-referenced to one of these curves or use a worst case default curve. Note 'that in band analysis CTX curves are 

not used and a gross default of C/1 = I IO db is used. 

For each channel capacity commonly used, an attempt has been made to choose a worst case or commonly used 
deviation and this is used as the reference to which other systems of similar capacity or deviation are cross~ 

referenced. These are listed in table B.3.2. I and B.3.2.2. All curves are broken down into the following categories 

of interference: 

a) Long haul (default) 
b) Long haul (specific) 
c) Short haul (default) 
d) Short haul (specific) 
The long haul curves and the short haul (default) cases allow a C/1 ratio that permits 4 dBrnCO of noise due to

) interference. For each case, Channel capacities that are commonly used for that application have been chosen from 

table B.3.2.1 and curves have been developed for each combination of these loadings. The default curves do not 
refer to any equipment type. 

The specific curves refer to a specific radio types. An equipment cross-reference is used when other equipment 
types which have no specific curves are used. The short haul (specific) curves define an absolute interfering power 
level that will increase the noise by I dB during a fade or cause I dB thre.shold degradation. The curves that are 
prepared for short haul cases have been chosen on a band basis. For each frequency band that is applicable to short 

haul, a common radio type and channel loading has been chosen. A separate curve has been drawn for each 

combination of channel loadings chosen for each band.

The curves have been prepared using a computer program developed by AGT. This program generates approximate 
spectra of both the desired and interfering signals, and convolves these spectra to arrive at the baseband 

interference spectrum and, hence, the interference objective. Further details are contained in Annex B.3.1 and 

Annex B.3.2. 

The threshold degradation for long haul is chosen as C/I = 50 dB and the spurious response limits c1t 70 and 140 

MHz are 20 and O dB respectively below the worst requriement, but attenuated by the filter clrnracteristics. 

For the default curves, filters are assumed to cut off at fc ± 1.5 (f + 2fB), where fc is the desired carrier frequency, f 
is the system peak deviation and fB is the top baseband frequency. A roll-off of 25 dB per octave was used. The 

specific curves use filter clrnracteristics based on the supplier's infornrntion. 

B.3.3 Dioital CTX's 
Considering the very significant effect that digital receiver filters have on the calculated CTX curves only specific 
CTX's will be prepared, but with the important proviso that victim traffic type and victim receiver equipment are 
considered matched pairs. 

Rules for assigning digital equipment and traffic: 

\. any digital equipment should be assigned a unique equipment code along with a unique traffic code ("matched" 
equipement and traffic code pairs); 

• if a new digital equipment is cross-referenced to an existing specific equipment type, the traffic type associated 
to the new equipment should be cross-referenced to the matched traffic type of the specific equipement. 
0

The following step by step procedure should be followed to assign new digital equipment and traffic codes: 

• assign new equipement code (consult with the FCSA Database Administrator); 
• assign a unique traffic code (consult with the FCSA DBA); 
• decide whether a family ofCTX's will be generated (radio system designer decision); 
• if no CTX's are going to be generated, cross-reference the equipment code and traffic code to an existing 
matched pair (radio system designer decision). Request approval of the cross references from equipment and 
CTX's coordinators and posting to the subsidiary MDB (FCSA DBA); 
• if CTX's are going to be generated, decide on family of CTX's (radio system designer decision' should 
consider all traffic types operating in the same and adjacent bands); 
• generate the family of CTX's (radio system designer): 
• request approval of the curves from the CTX's coordinators and posting to the subsidiary database (FCSA 
DBA). 
Example 

• a set ofCTX curves exists for equipment ABCD carrying traffic 777N ("matched traffic type"); 
• a user wants to add new equipment WXYZ, carrying traffic 7NNN, to the subsidiary database; 
• no specific set of CTX's would be prepared for equipment WXYZ, because the user wants to cross-reference it 
to equipment ABCD. 
Application of the proposed rules would imply, in this example, that along with cross-referencing equipment 
WXYZ to ABCD, the user should cross-reference traffic type 7NNN to traffic type 777N.

B.3.4 TSIP Use ofCTX's 
The information in these tables is accessed by either TSIP TS-TS or TS-ES in order to retrieve an interference 
objective for a given combination of desired and interfering traffic types, receiving equipment type, and frequency 
separation between the desired and interfering carriers. 

The user has the option to specify temporary CTX curves in his/her input for an interference analysis. These 
objectives are then used in preference to any information stored in the subsidiary tables. For·more details see 

section 4.8. 

B.3.5 CTX Input Screen 
The user can create or edit CTX tables on screen (screen 2.!.3A "CTX SDF Form"). For a detailed discussion of 
this CTX data screen see section 2.1-14 of the MICS User Guide.

Cautionary Notes 

The following error checking is done by SDB VALIDA TE on input to CTX: 

a) Traffic types must have up to 6 alpha-numerics and be in the sd_traffic table. 
b) The receiving equipment code must be in the sd_eqpt subsidiary table. 
c) There must be less than or equal to 150 data points. 
d) The maximum frequency separation must be equal or less than 400.00 MHz. 
B.3.7 Traffic Table 
All trafic codes, corresponding equipment codes, and traffic and equipment cross-references, are stored in the 

sd_traffic table. Up to date text files of this table, sorted by traffic code and sorted by equipment code, are 
maintained in the FCSA public directory for users' information (the files are $fcsap/traffic.rpt and $fcsap/eqtraf.rpt). 

) 

B.3.8 CTX Cross-Reference Search Sequesnce 
The number of possible combinations of desired traffic type, interfering traffic type and receive equipment type is 

very large, and it is impractical to generate or save CTX curves for all of these combination. Rather, it has. been 
decided to generate and store a limited number of widely used. curves, to cross-rerference other curves to these 
curves, and in the last resort to fall back on a default curve. 

Cross-referencing takes place at the level of traffic and equipment types. 

Traffic type cross-references are stored in the sd_traffic tables. 

Equipment type corss-references are stored in the sd_eqpt table. 

The cross-reference search sequence is given inthe following table. In this table, 

TFCR Victim traffic type 

XTFCR Cross-reference to TFCR, if available 

TFCJ Interfering traffic type 

XTFCJ Cross-reference to TFCJ, if available 

EQPR Receive equipment type 

XEQPR Cross-reference to EQPR, if available ·

Searching along this chain stops as soon as a valid CTX curve is found. 

If the entire chain has been searched through to the point where there are no more cross-references to continue the 
chain, then TSIP assumes that a valid CTX record cannot be found. In such cases, TSIP makes dafault assumptions 

(i.e. worst case CTX curve). 
B.3.9 CTX XREF Table 
The ctx_xreftabie was created to speed up the CTX search process in TSIP. This table contains all possible CTX's 

within a band an between adjacent bands (i.e. combination of traffic types and corresponding recieving equipment 

type) and cross-reference to existing CTX curves. This table is updated any time a new traffic and/or equipment 
type is added to the SDB. 

B.3. IO Generation of CTX Curves 
CTX curves can be generated directly by the users. The programs to produce the CTX's reside in the $ctxp 
directory, which is a public directory accessible to all users. There are three different programs to generate CTX's: 
ctxdoatd.exe, ctxdta.exe and ctxata.exe. The first one will be used when the victim traffic type is digital and the 

interfering traffic i~ analog or digital. The second one corresponds to an analog victim and digital interfering traffic, 
and the thrid one to the analog into analog case. 

The analog into analog program is rarely used, since most analog traffic types have CTX's or applicable crossreference, 
it has not been automated, like the other two. It requires manual input of the desired frequency 

separations. The users are advised to contact FCSA if they want to use this program .. 

The ctxdoatd.exe and ctxdta.exe programs require two input files and produce one output file. The input files are 
the 'victim receiver filter" file (which is a discrete representation of the total receiver filter characteristic) and the 
"interfering spectrum" file (which is a discrete representation of the transmitting frequency spectrum of the 
interfering transmitter). The output file is a table of frequency separation (between interfering and victim's carrier 

frequencies) Vs. maximum acceptable level of interference or carrier-to-interference ratio, depending on the type of 

traffics involved. 

Winter 1995 B.3 -10 TSIP Reference Manual 


Several filters, called xxx.vic, and interfering spectrum files, called xxx.int, are stored in the $ctxp directory. A user 
who wants to create CTX's for a new traffic-equipment type, can use these existing files in combination with the 
new files created for his/her new equipment. For example, a user wants to create CTX cu~vcs for a new equipment, 

ABCl23. The user has lo create the ABCl23.vic file (receiver filler) and the ABCl23.inl file (interfering 
spectrum). To create the analog 960 VF channels into his/her ABCl23 equipment CTX, the user will use the 
existing A0960.int file Vs. his/her ABC123.vic file. More details and examples illustrating the operation of these 

programs are given in the following sections. 

B.3.11 CTX Generation Programs Input Files 
B.3.11.1 Digital Interfere Dataset: 
The interfering spectrum file required by the CTX generation programs is a fixed format file, which is discussed 
below. 

The interferer dataset is composed of information taken from the digital radio's Power Spectral Density (PSD). The 
dataset represents one-half of the PSD of a digital signal assuming the PSD is symmetrical. If the PSD is not 
symmetrical, the half of the PSD curve with the greatest power contribution should be used. 

The digital interferer dataset format is given below:

Note: 
the arithmetic sign of the PSD values in the dataset is opposite to the actual sign. The PSD data is 
multiplied by -I within the CTX program. 

zeros must be used for null data to complete all 72 frequency and PSD entries. 

an interferer dataset is not required when a default digital interfer curve is selected; the CTX program 
prompts the user for the bandwidth of the digital interferer and generates a default dataset. 

The Power Spectral Density at frequencies above those provided by the supplier must be truncated to 
!50 dB starting at 0.1 MHz above the highest frequency given in the specifications to a frequency of 

400 MHz. 

TSIP Reference Manual B.3-11 Winter 1995 


-The Power Spectral Density is frequenctly measured using a 4 kHz slot, but if a different slot width is 

used, that data too will be acceptable. The program internally normalizes the data so no correction is 

requried. You do not need to specify the slot width that was used in the measurement. 

Example of Interfering Spectrum File 

The following file, example I .int was created using the "EXAMPLE 1" digital equipment output power spectrum

B.3. I1.2 Victim Receiver Dataset 
The victim receiver filter file is a fixed format file. This format is discussed below: 

The digital victim dataset contains a maximum of 24 data-paris of frequency versus frequency response. The 
dataset represents half the filter response under the assumption the response is perfectly symmetrical. In cases 

where the filter response is not symmetrial, it is best to use the half of the response which will give the most 

conservative results. The poor side of the filter response, which passes the most power and has the larges peaks at 
IF and 2 IF, will give conservative results. 

The following format should be used of the digital victim dataset:

-Al 140 is the RF filter response (dB) at carrier frequency shifted by twice the intermediate frequency 2XIF which 
can be found using the RF filter attenuation curve. SEE NOTE 2. 

-THDCRIT -is the Threshold Degradation Due to Interference of which a value of either I dB or 3 dB (for 
short-haul) is assumed. 

-(fi,ai) where 1=1,2, ... 24 are the Frequency Versus Frequency Response Data Point Pairs and are obtined from

-RF Filter Response -available within the manufacturers specification. Susceptibility to CW/Modulated 
and T/1 Interference Data is required to determine the specific IF and image response factors 
Susceptibility Curves and to create the victim dataset. 

NOTE]: If a user chooses a default selectivity, the program will still look for the first two lines in the dataset. Also, 
the selectivity data at frequencies above those provided by the supplier must be truncated to 110 dB 
starting 0.1 MHz above the highest frequency given in the specifications to a frequency of400 MHz. 

Winter 1995 B.3 -14 TSIP Reference Manual • 


NOTE2: The program uses A 170 and Al 140 as default values to approximate the If and Image response of the 
radio. It is preferred to use the SPECIFIC IF RESPONSE FACTOR and the SPECIFIC IMAGE 
RESPONSE FACTOR derived from the T/1 or C/1 curves. The program will prompt you for this 

information when on-line, and if values are entered, these values rather than the AI70 and AI 140 values 

will be used in preparation of the CTX curves. It is important to note that A!70 and Al 140 are by 
definition not the same as the Specific IF Response Factor and Specific Image Response Factor. AI70 and 
Al 140 are based on the response of the RF filter alone. The Specific Factors are based on the overall 
response of the radio. The values of the Specific Factors used should be entered in the comment Jines of 

the dataset sot hat a record is available. 

If you want the program to nm automatically with the more accurate Specific Factors, and do11 1t want to enter the 
Specific factors on-line, 

SUBSTITUTE THE SPECIFIC IF RESPONSE FACTOR MINUS 20 dB FOR AI70 in line 2 of database. 
(The program adds 20 dB to Al70 for the mixer attenuation to derive the Specific IF Response Factor) 

and 

SUBSTITUTE THE SPECIFIC IMAGE RESPONSE FACTOR FOR All40 in line 2 of the dataset. 
If these substitutions have been made, this should be stated in the comments i.e. "AI70 and Ail40 were derived 
from Specific Factors". 

Example of Victim Filter File 

The victim receiver filter file, examplel.vic, has been derived from the susceptibility to CW interference cur~e of 

the receiver. This is considered to be a good representation of the combined filtering effect of the receiver. The

Receiver Filter File Example 

Note that the value of the filter attenuation at the 1F frequency, 108.5 MHz, is 99.5 (dB). However, the value 
written in the first line of the file is 79.5 (dB). This is because the program adds a default value of20 (dB), thus the 
actual value used in the calculations will be 79.5 + 20 -99.5 (dB). (This default value is inserted for those cases 
where the user leaves this field blank).

Interfering Spectrum Files 

The analog FDM-FM interfering spectrum is generated internally by the CTX programs. Therefore, the input file 
contains only a set of parameters which permit the program to calculate the spectrum data points. The fonnat of this 
file is as follows:

To create a CTX the user has to perform the following steps: 

-create the XXX.int and XXX.vic files 
-copy these files to the $ctxp directory 
If the CTX desired is digital or analog into digital, call the ctxdoated.exe program (note that you have 
to type the .exe extension) 
If the desired CTX is digital into analog call the ctxdta.exe program 
If the desired CTX is analog into analog, call the ctxata.exe program. 
Follow the program prompts. 

As an example the examplel.int tile has been run against the example I.vie file (that is the EXAMPLES transmitter 

against the EXAMPLE I receiver). 

The commands, answer to program prompts and results (displayed on screen by the program) are presented on 

Table B.3.12.1. Note that comments to the program prompts are written in brackets.

B.5 FREQUENCY PLAN SlJBSIDIARY TABLE 
) 

B.5.1 Description 
The sd_plan is the subsidiary table containing all current and obsolete frequency plans applicable to 
terrestrial systems in Canada and the USA. Each frequency plan is listed in tabular form with up to four 
sets of frequencies. The plans are keyed off the Band Code (contained in the table) designating the band, 
e.g., the 4 GHz band is designated by 09 and hence BAND 09, PLAN 3 refers to the third type of 
frequency plan within this band. 

B.5.2 Input Criteria 
The frequency plan must be listed in an approved or draft SRSP or Industry Canada technical guidelines, or 
any FCC or USA carrier plans. 

B.5.3 Design Philosophv 
B.5.3.1 General 
A general characteristic of frequency plans is that they consist of maximally four sets of frequencies, two 

sets GO (transmit) and· two sets RETURN (receive) in which the two GO sets are orthogonally polarized 
with each other as are the two RETURN sets. One GO set is matched with one RETURN set which may or 
may not be copolar. Therefore it follows that each frequency plan may contain up to four sets of 
frequencies numbered one to four. For some plans some sets may be empty. 

The assignment of frequencies for any plan to the four sets is based on the following logic: 

I.· Set one is the set of frequencies which includes the lowest frequency in the plan. 

2. Let us take Set one as a reference and call it a GO set. Then Set two is the complimentary 
RETURN set, if is exists, which may be copolar or crosspolar with Set one. Set three, if it 
exists, is the second set of GO frequencies and is crosspolar to Set one. Set four, if it exists, is 

the second set of RETURN frequencies and is crosspolar with Set two. 

It is noted: 

I. Set one is never empty except for plans using different bands for transmit and receive 
frequencies (e.g. 4/6L satellite plan). 
2. The number of frequencies in each set of a plan is not necessarily equal. 
B.5.3.2 HILO an YH 
To completely define how a frequency plan is used (i.e., which sites are transmit high or low and whether 
frequencies have horizontal or vertical polarization) two additional variable are used. These are called 
HILO and VH. 

TSIP Reference Manual B.5-1 Winter 1995 


I-IILO tells you the I-JI-LO sequence by specifying whether Set on e is GO (transmit) or RETURN (receive) 
-recall that Set one contains the lowest frequency in the plan. HILO is defined by a single digit field of I 
through 6 or Odefined as follows: 

HILO DESIGNATION 

I-IJLO CODE TRANSMIT RECEIVE 

Set one only Set two only 
2 Set two only Set one only 
3 Set three only Set four only 
4 Set four only Set three only 
5 Set one or three or both Set two or four or both 
6 Set two or four or both Set one or tree or both 

0 Note of the above or unknown 

VH specifies whether frequencies have vertical or horizontal polarization. VH is defined by a single digit 

of l through 4 or Odefine as follows: 

POLARIZATION 

VHCODE SET l SET2 SET3 SET4 

V V H H 
2 H I-I V V 
3 V H H V 
4 H V V H 
0 none of the above or unknown 

0 

Note 1 

If you know HILO at one end of the LINK then you automatically know it at the other end. Recall that if 
Sets I and 3 are GO, then Sets 2 and 4 are RETURN. Hence ifat one end ofthe link HILO is I, 3 or 5 then 
at the other end of the link the HILO must be 2, 4 or 6 respectively. 

Note2 

PLAN = 00 implies HILO = 0 
HILO = 0 implies VH = 0 

This is a mandatory condition when entering PDF data. If any one of the 3 fields is zero, all of them have 
to be zero. 

8.5.4 Use 
Basically the sd_plan table provides a translation table of frequencies and plans. If the PLAN and BAND 
are known this table provides a list of all the frequencies in the PLAN. Conversely, if one or more 
frequencies of a link are known then the appropriate PLAN and BAND can be obtained. This information 

is used: 

l. To assign PLAN and Band to Canadian and USA data. 
2. In TS-TS or TS-ES interference calculations requiring frequency separation data.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
This report documents the instructions for executing two computer programs which generate CTX curves associated 
with digital radio equipment. The purpose of this report is to provide MICS users with instructions on using these 
CTX programs. To that end this report should be included into the MICS documentation which is to be kept at 
FCSA headquarters. 

The CTX programs compute carrier to interference ratio (C/1) and absolute interference power level (I) for 
specific victim and interferer traffic pairs in accordance with long haul and short haul criteria. For a discussion on 
the definition of C/1 and I the reader should refer to references 1 and 2. 

Section 2 discusses the philosophy of the CTX program. It provides an introduction to the computer programs 
which are used to generate the CTX curves. The discussion includes interference criteria, spurious response, default 
filter characteristics and transmit spectrum characteristics. 

Section 3 defines the algorithms used in the CTX coniputer programs. User options are also discussed here. 

Section 4 provides a discussion on the data which is needed to characterize victims and interferers. This section also 
provides the instruction for creating computer data files and examples.

2.0 DISCUSSION ON THE CTX PROGRAM 
There are two FORTRAN computer programs stored in the FCSA ALPHA computer which can be used to generate 
digital into digital or analog-digital CTX's. CTXDOATD is the program used for computing AID and DID 
interference objectives, and CTXDTA is the program used for computing DIA interference objectives. 

2.1 ACRONYMS 
This Section defines the acronyms and user selectable options which are implemented into the CTX computer 
programs. The acronyms are defined as : 

I. ABW = Authorized Bandwidth of digital victim (MHz). 
2. ABWI = Authorized Bandwidth of digital interferer (MHz). 
3. NF= Noise figure of victim receiver (dB). 
4. NI = Number of telephone channels in the victim baseband. 
5. N2 = Number of telephone channels in the interferer baseband. 
0

2.2 THE PROGRAM CTXDOATD 
The name ctxdoatd.exe is an acronym for CTX Digital Or Analog To Digital. It is the name given to the 
executable (compiled) program which computes I for the AID and DID interference cases. This program generates 
a set of data point-pairs of I values versus frequency separation between victim and interferer carrier frequencies 
(fs) for specific victim/interferer traffic pairs spanning a frequency range from 0 to 300 MHz. We have elected to 
use a logarithmically delineated frequency axis for efficient use of computing time and enhanced resolution for 
small frequency separations. 
Associated with this program are two input files; a digitial victim data file and either an anlogue or digital data file 
to define the interferer characteristics. 

2.3 THE PROGRAM CTXDTA 
The nme ctxdta.exe is an acronym for CTX Digital To Analog. It is the name given to the executable program 
which computes C/I and I values for DIA interference cases, This program generates a list of C/I and I values 
versus frequency separation (between victim and interferer carrier frequencies) for specific victim/interferer traffic 
pairs spanning a frequency range from 0 to 300 MHz. The frequency is indexed using .a logarithmic scale for the 
same reason as that stated in Section ·2.1. Note that in both programs, frequency separations are chosen by the 
program within the range 0 to 300 MHz. This was determined as a practical range but software changes could 
permit values outside this range for special situations. Associated with this program are two input files; an analogue 
victim data file and a digital interferer spectrum file to define the characteristics. 

) 

2.4 THE BASIS OF CTX CALCULATIONS -ANALOG VICTIMS 
Interference calculations dealing with analog victims use both the long and short haul interference criteria as used in 
the analogue into Analogue program, These are discussed herein. 

2.4.1 Long Haul Interference Criterion 
For long haul D/A CTX curves, the program· calculates the C/I (dB) level which would generate 4 dBrnc0 of noise 
into the worst baseband voice channel of the victim receiver for a given carrier separation, Meanwhile, it ensures 
that the threshold effect requirement is not exceeded and assumes a spurious response characteristic of the victim, 

2.4.2 Short Haul Criterion 
For short haul D/A curves, the program calculates the absolute interference level !WORST (dBm) that causes I dB 
noise degradation in the worst (usually top) voice channel for specific carrier separations. This means that the 
interference noise will be 5.87 dB below the top thermal noise. Meanwhile, it ensures that the threshold degradation 

criterion is not violated and assumes a spurious response characteristic for the victim·. 

TSIP Reference Manual B.3.1 -3 Spring 1996 


2.5 BASIS OF CTX CALCULATIONS -DIGITAL VICTIMS 
When ·a digital victim is involved, the program calculates the absolute interference power level (I dBm) that causes 
I dB degradation of the victim's threshold for specific frequency separations. It also calculates the spurious 
response at first and second IF frequencies in accordance with the information provided by the user, or by assuming 
the pre-determined default values in the program. The I dB threshold degradation criterion is provisional and will 
be re-evaluated by FCSA. The software can accept values other than I dB for private studies. It has also been 
proposed by the Radio Advisory Board of Canada (Subcommittee D) that for bands where rain attenuation controls 
outage that a 3 dB degradation of threshold is appropriate, This is based on producing similar degradation of 
availability by interference for rain and multipath fading mechanisms. Three dB degradation has been employed for 
equipment using 18 GHz and above. 

The program calculates an Interference Power Factor (!PF) in dB. This factor represents the correction relative to 
the thermal noise power to determine the permitted interference power level assuming no improvement by filtering. 
The filtering effect is added separately (see below). 

!PF = 10 log (10 ** (THDCRIT/10)-1) 

!PF = Interference Power Factor 

where THDCRIT is the permitted Threshold Degradation due to interference 

Note: For THDCRIT = I dB, !PF = -5.87 

Although the program will permit any value ofTHDCRIT; values of I and 3 are assumed and will be further studied 
for use by FCSA. 

2.5.1 Interference Level Calculation 
The interference objective for digital victims is calculated by using the equation (for a discussion on the derivation 
ofthis equation refer to reference 2). 
ILVL = NTH+ !PF+ ESEL 

where ILVL = Interference objective (dBm). 

NTH = Thermal noise of the victim receiver (dBm). 

!PF Interference power Factor (dB) 

ESEL = Effective selectivity of the receiver to a particular interferer, calculated as the total power, 
relative to unity, that the victim rejects at the frequency separation of interest ( dB). 

Spring 1996 B.3.1 -4 TSIP Reference Manual 


2.6 SPURIOUS RESPONSE CRITERION 
This criterion deals with the spurious response at Interfering frequency separations relative to the victim 
corresponding to separations near the IF frequency and 2 times the IF frequency. The Image spurious response at 
separation near twice the IF frequency is equal to the responses at frequency separation equal to the absolute value 
of frequency separation minus twice the IF frequency, but attenuated by the value of the specific RF filter response 
or the default RF filter response, or a specific factor provided by the user. The spurious response at first IF (IF) is 
equal to the response at frequency separation equal to the absolute value of frequency separation minus twice the IF 
frequency but attenuated by the specific factor provided by the user, or the value of the specific RF filter response 
plus 20 dB or the default. 

In summary the first IF response is: 
ILVL = ILVLWORST + Specific IF Filter Response, 
or = ILVLwoRST + Specific RF Filter Response + 20 dB, 
or = ILVLWORST + Default Filter Response/2 + 20 dB. 

) 
) 
In summary the Image response (2x XIF) is: 
ILVL = ILVLWORST + Specific Image Response Factor, 
or ILVLWORST + Specific RF Filter Response, 
or ILVLWORST + Default filter Response/2. 

The above calculations are shown in order of preference. ILVL worst is the corresponding main response objective. 
in cases where specific factors for IF and 2IF responses are not available from manufactures, the program will 
calculate the alternate values. The D to A program prompts for specific RF filter attenuation's at IF and 2IF. 

2.7 DEFAULT FILTER CHARACTERISTICS 
In order to simplify data processing and storage, calculations of interference objectives could be done by assuming a 
default receive filter response when desired, This default filter response was arrived at by studying the IF and RF 
characteristics of several equipment types and applying conservative approximations. 

a. Analog Default Filter 
a. I Cut Off Frequency 
where Fco = Maximum half bandwidth cut off frequency 
ocp = 3.76 (Lloc x 10 NLR/20) 

LlOC = RMS per channel frequency deviation 
NLR = Noise load ratio 
=-15+10logN N;;:240 
= -1 +4 logN N<240 

TSIP Reference Manual B.3.1-5 Spring 1996 


N = Number of voice channels 
fm = Maximum baseband frequency 

a.2 Attenuation Beyond Cutoff 
The analog default filter rolls off at 25 dB per octave, from J = Jco to a maximum attenuation of 60 dB. 
This attenuation (60dB) is reached at a normalized frequency of 

fH = flfco 
fH = 5.27803 

a.3 Attenuation for f > fH 
The filter attenuation for f > fH is 60 (dB). 

b. Digital Default filter 
A default digital filter has been defined for use with American systems or for evaluation of unknown products. This 
filter is better than the analogue default and is defined in terms of the Authorized Bandwidth (ABW) specified in 
MHz. 

The authorized bandwidth (ABW) is used only to calculate the noise floor for the default digital victim in the default 
selectivity formula. As such, it should approximately correspond to the 3 dB filter bandwidth. If filter information 
is not available it may be defined as the necessary bandwidth for the desired modulation method/bit rate. 

Working Group U, that worked on the specification of Digital/Analog interference criteria has defined the digital 
default selectivity as follows: 

I. 0 dB attenuation for frequency separation from centre of assigned channel to 0.4 ABW. 
2. 60 dB/octave attenuation for frequency separations of0.4 ABW to 0.5 ABW. i.e., 20 dB maximum 
attenuation. 

3. 20 dB attenuation from 0.5 to 0.625 ABW 
4. 30 dB/octave from 0.625 ABW to 5 ABW. i.e., 110 dB maximum attenuation. 
5. 110 dB attenuation 5 ABW to 400 MHz. 
Note: Although the program uses frequency separations up to 300 MHz, filter and spectrum curves have 
been plotted to 400 MHz. These are independent factors chosen separately by W/GU and should 
not be confused.

2.8 DEFAULT SPECTRUM CHARACTERISTICS 
The default digital spectrum assumes the shape of the FCC emission mask for out of band energy and within the 
allocated channel the total energy is assumed to be uniformly distributed. The agreed FCSA default digital 
spectrum defines the power of any emission in a 4kHz bandwidth to be attenuated below the mean total output 
power by the following amounts: 

I. Within the Authorized bandwidth 
Attenuation = 10 log ABW/0.004 (ABW in MHz) 

2. At frequencies that are removed from the assigned frequency by greater than +50% ofthe authorized 
bandwidth the attenuation is calculated by the formula 
Attenuation (dB) = 35 + 0.8*(p -50)+ 10 log(ABW), 

Where: P = percent of bandwidth removed from the assigned frequency (from center). 
(P =0 for centre frequency and 50 for the assigned channel edge) 

ABW = Licenced (authorized) bandwidth (MHz) 
(See discussion ofABW under default filters) 

Note: The spectrum attenuation is limited to the range from a minimum of 50 dB to a maximum of 80 
dB, for P greater than 50 percent. 
This formula does not define attenuation for O< p< 50 (see I above).

) The default analogue spectrum is based on the same formula used in the existing Analogue 
into Analogue Program (based on analogue parameters). 

2.8.1 Range of First and Second IF Responses 
For IF and Image responses, the main responses from O -0.5 XIF is shifted to IF and 2IF. The responses are 
truncated beyond ±0.5 XIF. An image of these responses is also created below IF and 2IF (image) to create the 
complete IF and image responses. 

2.9 BRICKWALLFILTER 
The program calculates a brickwall and 3 dB filter bandwidth in cases where specific filters are used. The receiver 
thermal noise is then calculated by using the narrowest ofthese two bandwidths in the familiar KTBF formula. The 
program calculates an 'equivalent' power received through the receiver selectivity form an assumed broadband 
noise source. It then determines the bandwidth of a perfect filter (brickwall) that will receive the same power. This 
bandwidth is the 'brickwall filter' bandwidth and is used in conjunction with determining the thermal noise floor. 

2.10 3 DB BANDWIDTH 
The program also calculates the 3 dB receiver selectivity from input data. This is used to evaluate the thermal noise 
floor as discussed below: 

TSIP Reference Manual B.3.1-9 Spring 1996 


Thermal Noise Floor 

The thermal noise floor is critical as the interference objectives are referenced to this value, the 'thermal noise' 
represents an 'equivalent' noise power, referenced to the input of the receiver that limits receiver performance, It 
includes a factor for receiver contributions, i.e. through the Noise Figure of the receiver. 

The thermal noise floor is normally calculated from the familiar KTBF formula. The program has three methods of 
arriving at a thermal noise floor value, 

a) The preferred method is to input a value as measured and provided by the supplier. 
The program prompts for this value. 
b) As discussed earlier, the program determines two bandwidth values from input 
selectivity data that can be used in the KTBF formula. The program uses the narrower 
of the two bandwidths to arrive at the 'worst case' interference objective per FCSA's 
groundrules for program development. 
c) For the default receiver case, the program applies the 'authorized bandwidth' (ABW) as 
B in the KTBF formula. 
2.11 OPTIONS 
The CTX computer programs provide the user with the following options: 

I. Input a specific filter data OR use the default filter ofsection 2.6 as calculated within the program. 
2. Input a specific digital spectra data file OR use the default digital spectra of section 2. 7 as calculated within the 
program. 
3. Input a specific IF response factor OR use RF specific filter response+ 20 dB (program uses input data file) OR 
use default RF filter response + 20 dB. 
4. Input a specific 2IF response factor OR use a specific RF filter response (program uses input data file) OR use 
default RF filter response by the program. 
5. Input thermal noise level or let the program calculate thermal noise level based on the narrower of the brickwall 
or 3 dB filter bandwidth. 
See figure 2.1 for specific IF response factor definition and specific 2IF response factor definition. 

Note: Due to the conservative nature of the digital filter default spectra and curves, it is recommended that default 
options be used in preliminary broad studies only.

3.0 SUPPLIERS DATA-CHARACTERIZE VICTIMS AND INTERFERERES 
This section discusses the data needed to characterize analog and digital victims and interferers. Data should be 
obtained from equipment suppliers. Instructions for creating digital victim and digital interferer data sets are 
discussed here. 

3.1 DATA REQUIRED TO CHARACTERIZE DIGITAL VICTIMS 
The following digital victim data is needed to prepare AID or DID CTX curves: 

I. RF filter attenuation referenced to circulator input port (in dB) at fIF removed from the victim's carrier 
frequency (A 170). 
2. RF filter attenuation referenced to circulator input port (in dB) at 2fIF removed from the victim's carrier 
frequency (AI140). 
3. Receiver noise figure referenced to circulator input port (dB) (NF). 
4. Authorized bandwidth (ABW) in MHz. 
5. Intermediate frequency (MHz) (XIF). 
6. Susceptibility to CW interference curve or alternatively combined IF+ RF + BB filter data. 
7. Determine Threshold Degradation Criterion(see section 2.4). 
For a discussion on generating data files refer to Section 4.5. 

The above data is used to generate the input data set for the DOA TD program. 

3.1.1 Susceptibility to CW Interference 
This section discusses the preferred method to obtain victim specific selectivity data. The method uses the 
supplier's susceptibility to CW interference data on specific equipment types. This data is often available from 
suppliers, usually in graph form. It contains the combined RF + IF + BB filter data. Filter characteristics are 
obtained by inverting the susceptibility to CW interference curve and adjusting the scale for O attenuation at f0. 
Considering both sides of the response curve created from the susceptibility curve, choose the point of least 
attenuation for each point of frequency separation from the centre frequency. Note that at frequency separations 
equal to the IF frequency and twice the IF frequency, the response may be due to another mechanism (Image or IF 
response) and will not provide an approximation to selectivity in this range. These responses will show up as abrupt 
jumps in the 'Susceptibility to CW interference curves. In this case, the selectivity must be interpolated in the range 
where IF and Image responses are controlling. 

The preferred source of Image and If response data is also from the Susceptibility to CW Interference curves. 

Figure 1 in section 3 shows an example of determining the 'Specific IF and Image Response Factors'. See Section 

3.1.3 for susceptibility to CW Interference Testing Procedure. 
Spring 1996 B.3.1 -12 TSIP Reference Manual 


Note that the 'Threshold to Interference' (CW T/I) curves provide the same data as 'Susceptibility to CW 

Interference'. US manufactures provide T/I curves but may not be available for the wider separations used by 

FCSA. 

3.1.2 Combined RF+ IF+ BB Filter Data 
In some cases, suppliers may provide the required selectivity information that included RF, IF and baseband effects. 
This may be available in separate curves for each component. In the case, they must be combined to make a single 
selectivity curve. 

Further, the suppliers generally do not provide full range plots to 400 MHz. To be compatible with our software 
and to optimize our accuracy, Working Group U agreed to extrapolate the curve per the following rule: 

I. Beyond the frequency range (fmaxl provided by the supplier, truncate the selectivity to I 10 dB starting at 
frequency fmax + 0.1 MHz. 
2. Attenuation to remain to 110 dB from fmax + 0.1 to 400 MHz 
Figure 3.1.2 provides a graphic display of selectivity extrapolation of a supplier's curve.

3.1.3 Susceptibility to CW Interference Testing Procedure 
3.1.3.1 Background 
The Frequency Coordination System Association (FCSA has adopted 'Susceptibility to CW Intererence' as a 
method to determine the receiver selectivity. This method is used when suppliers are unable to provide overall 
receiver relectivity data that includes RF, IF and baseband filtering components. 

Members should ask equipment suppliers to provide this information for new products to improve generation of 
allowable interference levels involving their products. 

3.1.3.2 Discussion 
The Susceptibility of CW Interference technique measures the CW interference level, at some frequency separation 
from the victim centre frequency, that degrades the victim receiver's threshold by some value, usually !db. The 
method uses a pseudorandom bit stream/BER test set pair to determine the threshold without interfeerence at some 
BER (normally 1 o·'). 

The desired signal level is increased, usually by I dB, and the interference level is increased until the BER returns to 
thevalue used to measure threshold. This procedure is repeated for various interering frequencyies. Figure 3.1.3.l 
is a typical test set-up for waveguide systems; a similar setup using coaxial components could be used as necessry. 
Note also that a coaxial system with transitions to waveguide could be used if preferred. 

) Procedure 

1. Set up equipment per figure 3.1.3.1 using waveguide or coaxial components as discussed above. 
2. Power up test transmitter/receiver and BER test equipment. Ensure that sufficient RF attenuation is 
inserted to avoid overdriving the receiver. 
3. Perform recommended aliganment procedures on tranmitter and receiver to optimize threshold. Measure 
threshold, without interference, by turning off the interference source and increasing attenuationof test 
transmitter until BER of 104 is indicated on BER test set. Record threshold for BER of 1o·' on test form 
(attachment 1). 
4. Increase desired signal level 1 db above recorded threshold value by removing 1dB of attenuation. 
Note: This adjustment is the most critical adjustment of the procedure. Where reading accuracy of the 
variable attenuator limits this adjustment, a narrower range attenuator or direct power 
measurement may be necessary. 

4

5. Activate signal generator (unmodulated) and increase level until BER of 10 is measured. R~cord the 
itnerference level, referenced to the test receiver input, ant he test form. If the available signal source is 
not level and frequency calibrated, external calibration via a directional coupler is suggested per Figure 
3.1.3.2. 
6. Repeat test 1-5 for various frequency separation up to 300 MHz on both sides fo the victim receiver center 
frequency. Record on test form. 
TSIP Reference Manual B.3.1-15 Spring 1996 


The test frequencies should include: 

a) co-channel (zero separation) 
b) at least 6 equally spaced frequencies wihtin the assigned bandwidth of the victim. 
c) at least 10 frequencies at separation between 0.SBW and 2 IF (Image), on each side of victim's· 
assignment. This should include critical frequecies such as inflection points, filter poles and 
transition to areas of sepp slope. 
d) Separation equal to 2IF (Image) and IF frequencies. 
e) At least four frequencies between 2IF and 300 MHz operation on each side of victim's 
assignment. 
7. Plot interference level (dB on vertical linear scale) vs. frequency separation (on horizontal logarithmic 
scale).

3.2 DATA REQUIRED TO CHARACTERIZE ANALOG VICTIMS 
The following information is need to characterize an analog victim for the CTXDTA program: 

I. Number of telephone channels in the victim baseband (NI). 
2. Minimum baseband frequency MHz of victim (FMIN I). 
3. Maximum baseband frequency MHz of victim (FM!). 
4. RMS per channel frequency deviation (MHz) of victim (DSIG !). 
5. Noise figure (dB) of victim (NF). 
6. Intermediate frequency (XIF) in MHz. 
7. A data set characterizing the frequency response of the analog victim. This includes victim's combined RF and 
IF filter response. 
Only items 1-6 are required if a default analogue victim is assumed. All data is required if a specific analogue 
victim is being considered. Refer to the examples in the next section for preparing the analogue victim data sets. 

3.3 DATA REQUIRED TO CHARACTERIZE DIGITAL INTERFERERS 
The CTXDOATD program permits operation with a default or specific digital interferer. The program generates the 
curve for a default interferer. For specific curves a data set characterizing the normalized power spectral density 
(PSD) of the digital interferer is required. This data set consists of a maximum of 36 frequency -PSD data pointpairs. 
PSD data should be in terms of power ratio ( dB) per 4 KHz slot relative to total power. For a discussion on 
creating an interferer data set refer to section 4.5.1. Note that the program normalized the curves to a power equal 
to unity in the spectrum thus it is possible to input for 'slot' bandwidth other than 4 KHz. However, the s_ame 
bandwidth must be used for the whole curve including correction of the last dated points to -150 dBm/4 KHz slot. 

Equipment suppliers usually provide empirical transmitter PSD data,' for specific equipment types, over a limited 
frequency range. Their data is often in graph form where transmitter PSD data was obtained using a spectrum 
analyzer. This measurement should be taken at the radio branching network antenna port. The problem associated 
with the limited frequency range of a supplier's PSD data is exactly the same as for filter data which we have 
discussed I Section 4.1. To overcome this problem we must extend the frequency range. Supplier's PSD data is 
extended by choosing the last data point which is 3 dB above the noise floor of the manufacturer's spectrum 
analyzer. The spectrum analyzer noise floor is identified as the portion of the PSD trace which shows a trend 
approaching a horizontal line (at the tail ends of the spectrum). Using that point, roll the PSD off within a 0.1 MHz 
interval to a PSD level of maximum -150 dB/4 KHZ below total power. The PSD remains constant at the -150 dBm 
level for the remaining frequency range (to 400 MHz). FCSA Working Group U agreed to use 150 dB as the 
maximum loss reduction in PSD at wide separation in a 4 KHz slot relative to the total power. This value produces 
results in line with actual measured results. Figure 3.3.1 provides an example of extrapolation of supplier's 
spectrum data. In addition, the following points should be considered when preparing PSD data sets: 

I. The graphic ( original) data should be digitized by using a series of maximum length concatenated chords which 
approximates the graph to within 1.0 dB. Peaks should be rounded out. 
Spring 1996 B.3.1-20 TSIP Reference Manual 


2. The following may be helpful for selecting data points: 
choose the centre of the spectrum 
more points should be chosen in the higher portion of the curve 
data points should be selected at each end of a horizontal straight line portion of a curve 
choose several points around the 'knee' of the curve (main rolloff). 
select a few points along any sloping straight line portion of the curve. More points will 
minimize error inherent in the calculation methods particularly for steep curves. 
3. Should a manufacturer's PSD data be given in a bandwidth slot which is other than 4 KHz, this data can be 
converted as required to power in a 4 KHz slot (dBm)/4 KHz by adding a bandwidth conversion factor (BWC 
to the manufacture's data using the formula: 
BWC = 10*log(4kHz/Bw) 

Here BW is the manufacturer's resolution bandwidth (KHz) of the test spectrum analyzer.

3.4 DATA REQUIRED TO CHARACTERIZE ANALOG INTERFERERS 
The CTXDOA TD program always generates the analogue interferer spectrum and will not permit a specific analog 
interferer curve. The analogue interferer PSD for various telephone channel loading is generated in a subroutine of 
program DOA TDEX ( called SPECT). To characterize an analog interferer the following information is required in 
the analogue interferer input data set: 

1. Number of voice channels (N2). 
2. Minimum baseband frequency (MHz) ofthe interferer (FMIN2). 
3. Maximum baseband frequency (MHz) of the interferer (FM2). 
4. RMS per channel frequency deviation (MHz) of interferer (DXIG2). 
See below for creation of a typical analogue interferer data set. 
Spring 1996 B.3.1 -22 TSIP Reference Manual 


3.5 CREATING INTERFERER & VICTIM DA TA SETS 
Specific spectrum and filter characteristics are inputted into the program during execution via data sets. 

3.5.1 The Digital Interferer PSD Data Set 
The interferer's PSD data set can contain up to 36 data-pairs of frequency versus PSD values (one data set per 
interferer type). The data set used in CTX curve generation represents one-half of the normalized PSD of a digital 
signal under the assumption that the PSD is perfectly symmetrical. We denote frequency (MHz) and PSD (-dBm/4 
KHz) values by fl, !2, ... 136, and SI, S2, S3, ... S36 respectively. The name used to identify the interferer PSD 
data set can be any combination to a maximum of six alpha-numeric characters; however, the name appearing in the 
data set (i.e., NAME I) is not limited in length or even character type. To avoid the tedious entry of minus signs (-) 
for negative PSD date (which is usually all of the PSD data points), PSD data is entered as positive numbers. The 
CTX curve generating programs are designed to change the positive PSD data appearing in data sets to negative 
PSD data (i.e., the CTX program multiplies the inputted data by -1 ). 

The interferer PSD data must be arranged in the following format: 

) 
) 
INTERFERER: NAME! 
fl, !2, 13, f4, f5, f6, fl, f8, f9, fl 0, fl I, fl2/ 

SI, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10, SI I, Sl2/

S25,S26,S27,S28,S29,S30,S31,S32,S33,S34,S35,S36/ 

Note that for default digital interferer curves that a data set is not required and the program will prompt the user for 
the bandwidth ofthe digital interferer. 

As an example of a digital interferer data set consider the spectral density data of a RD-6A transmitter: 

0,5, 10, II, 15, 17,20,20.l,22,22.4/

3.5.2. The Analogue Interferer Data Set 
This data set consists of three lines. The first line identifies the Analogue Interferer modulation. The second line 
identifies the four parameters discussed earlier needed to generate the spectrum and the last line identifies the latest 
revisions to the data set.

Note: That all frequencies are provided in MHz. 

3.5.3 Digital Victim Filter Data Set 
Data sets which characterize a victim's filter response can contain a maximum of24 data-pairs of frequency versus 
frequency response (one data set per victim). This data represents half the filter response under the assumption that 
the response is perfectly symmetrical. To discuss, in general terms, victim data point entries, we denote frequency 
(MHz) and filter response (dB) by fl, 12, f3, ...124 and Al, A2, A3 ... A24 respectively where a data point pair is (fi, 
Ai) for 1=1,2, ... 24. The name of the victim data set can be any combination to a maximum of six alpha-numeric 
characters; however the name appearing in the data set itself (i.e., NAME2) is not limited in length or character 
type. 

The filer response must be arranged in the following format: 

VICTIM: NAME2 
ABW, NF, XIF, Al70, AI140, THDCRIT/ 
fl, 12, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, fl 0, fl I, fl2/ 
Al, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, AIO, Al 1, Al2/ 
fl3, fl4, fl5, fl6, fl 7, fl 8, fl9, 120,121,122,123, 124/ 
A13, A14, A15, Al6, Al7, Al8, Al9, A20, A21, A22, A23, A24/ 

Notes: 

I. The first line is a name which designates the victim equipment type. 
2. The second line contains the victim's authorized bandwidth (ABW), noise figure (NF) in dB, IF frequency in 
MHz (XIF), RF filter response (dB) at carrier frequency shifted by IF frequency (AI70), RF filter response (dB) 
at carrier frequency shifted by 2XIF frequency (AI140) and the threshold degradation (THDCRIT). Note: For 
the value of THDCIRT to be used see paragraph 2.4. The program allows the use of other values for private 
studies. 
3. The remaining four lines contain the victim's filter response. 
Spring 1996 B.3.1-24 TSIP Reference Manual 


Note that if the user decides to use 'default' selectivity, the program will .still look for the first two lines in the data 
set. 

As an example consider the overall frequency response of a RD-6A receiver. The response data set is shown below: 

VICTIM: RD-6A 
30, 3.7, 70, 110, 118.1/ 
0, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26/

REVISED: 1989 10 16: LCA. 
Specific Image Response Factor: 114 dB 
Specific IF Response Factor: 112 dB 

Note the last 3 lines are informational for users creati!lg CTX curves. 

Note the use of zero fill for null data. 

3.5.4 The Analogue Victim Data Set 
. The CTXDTA program requires an analogue victim data set. The format is as follows: 

) 
) 
Victim: (# of analogue Channels) 

NI, FMlNI, FM!, PSIGI, MF, XIF 
fl, f2, f3 ..........fl2/ 
Al, A2, A3 .............Al2/ 
Fl3, Fl4, Fl5 ............ F24/ 
Al 3, Al4, Al5 ............ A24/ 
(update information) 

Notes: 

1. The first designates the equipment/modulation information of the analogue equipment. 
2. The second line provides the analogue parameters: number of channels (NI), minimum baseband frequency 
(FM!Nl), maximum baseband frequency FM!, per channel deviation (DSIGI), Noise figure (NF) and 
Intermediate Frequency (XIF). All frequencies are in MHz. 
3. Lines 3 to 5 provide the specific selectivity information where "ti" is the frequency separation and "Ai" is the 
corresponding attenuation. These lines are optional and are not required if the default selectivity option is 
chosen. 
The following is an example victim data set for the 'Reference' 300 channel analogue victim.

B.4.3 TSIP 1Jse of Equipment Table 
TSIP uses the equipment code, from the channel record of the PDF or MOB channel table, as the key to enter the sd_eqpt table. 
From this table TSIP retrieves the traffic code and frequency stability. 

With the eq'uipm~nt and traffic codes of both the interfering and victim stations, TSIP can search for the applicable CTX or its 
cross-reference. Once the CTX has been formed TSIP calculates the interference requirement. To do this the program uses the 
nominal carrier frequency separation, between victim and interference carriers, and the frequency stability of both, victim 
receiver and interfering transmitter. The nominal frequency separation plus or minus the stability of transmitter and receiver 
determines a frequency range, TSIP looks for the worst interference requirement in this range and uses it as the interference 
requirement for the case under study.

2.0 General of Default CTX Curves 
Basis of Calculations 

A computer program that generates analog to analog CTX curves (ctxata.exe) resides in the CTX public directory 
($ctxp) of the MICS system. This program, in accordance with the long haul and short haul interference criteria, 

calculates the permissible carrier to interference ratio (C/IdB) and absolut, interference level (!dBm) for specific 

victim and interferer traffic pairs. 

In order to simplify data processing and storage, calculations are done by assuming a default receiver filter 
response. The is response was arrived at by studying the IF and RF filter responses of several equipment types and 
applying conservative approximations. It rolls off at 25 dB per octave to a maximum attenuation of 60 dB after its 
maximum half bandwidth cut off frequency Fco, given by: 

F =1.5 (a + 2 f )

co p 111 

where F = Maximum half bandwidth cut off frequency 

eo 


!icr = RMS per channel frequency deviation 

NLR Noise load ration 

= -15+ 10 logN N;,, 240 

-I + 4 log N N < 240 

N = Number of voice channels 

fm = Maximum baseband frequency 

For long haul CTX curves, the program calculates the maximum C/1 that generates 4dBrnc0 of noise in the worst 
voice channel in the baseband ofthe victim receiver for carrier separations of0 to 327 MHz. Meanwhile, it ensures 
that a threshold effect requirement is not exceeded and assumes a spurious response characteristic for the victim. 
These criteria are further described below. 

(1) 4dBrnc0 NOISE CRITERION 
This criterion is calculated by using the equation 

C/1 = 84 -NPRo -BWR + NLR 

where NPRo = Noise Power Ratio a C/l 0 dB 
BRW = Bandwidth Ratio 
OCCUPIED BASEBAND BANDWIDTH 

= 10 log 

VOICE CHANNEL BANDWIDTH 

NLR = Noise Load Ratio, previously defined 

Winter B.3.2 -2 TSIP Reference Manual 


J 

(2) THRESHOLD EFFECT CRITERION 
This criterion, by assuming a 40 dB fade margin and a threshold to interference ratio of 1OdB to avoid capture of the 
demodulator by the interfering signal during fades of the desired signal, imposes a minimum C/1 ratio given by 

CI I . = 50 -FILTER RESPONSE 
mm 

(3) SPURIOUS RESPONSE CRITERION 
This criterion deals with the spurious responses at±140 MHz and ±70 MHz. The spurious responses at±140 MHz 

are equal to the responses at± f01 MHz but attenuated by an assumed 60 dB rejection. The spurious responses at 

±70 MHz are conservatively estimated to be 20 dB down from the response at MHz in addition to the filter 

± f111 

attenuation. 

For short haul CTX curves, the program calculates the absolute interference level (!dBm) that causes I dB noise 

degradation in the worst (top) voice channel for carrier separation of0 to 327 MHz. This means that the 

interference noise will be 5.87 dB below the top slot thermal noise during a full fade. Meanwhile, it ensures that a 

threshold degradation criterion is not violated and assumes a spurious response characteristics for the victim. In 
details, these criteria are: 

(I) !dB NOISE DEGRADATION CRITERION 
This criterion is calculated by using the equation

I= NPR -139.1 + NF -20log(L>cr I fm ) + BWR • NLR

where NPRo = NPR at C/l = 0 

NF = Receiver noise figure of the victim 

L>cr = RMS Per channel frequency deviation 

= Maximum baseband frequency 

f011 

Hp (f ) = Relative deviation of fm I due to pre• emphasis

ml · 
BWR Bandwidth ratio, previously defined 

NLR Noise load ratio, previously defined 

(2) THRESHOLD DEGRADATION CRITERION 
This criterion permits a I dB degradation to the FM improvement threshold. With this requirement, the 
interference noise power will be 5.87 dB below the front end thermal noise power at the input to the 

demodulator1 i.e.: 

I= -174+ !0logBW+NF-5.87 (dBm) 

where BW = Noise bandwidth of the receiver in Hz

.J NF = Noise figure of victim receiver

(3) SPURIOUS RESPONSE CRITERION 
Same as in the long haul case. 

2.2 PROGRAM ARCHITECTURE 
The CTX program consists of a main program labelled CIDR I, two subroutines labelled SPECT and COVJ I and 

one function routine labelled DYAL. The main program incorporated the subroutines to perform the main 
processing while the subroutine COVRI 1 utilizes the function routine DVAL for linear data interpolations. 

The subroutine SPEC is called by the main program CIDR I to calculate the approximate spectra of both the desired 

and interference signals. The subroutine COVRII is-also called by the main program to calculate the required I and 

C/1 values by using the results of subroutine SPEC. 

2.3 PROGRAM EXECUTION AND INPUT/O])TPUT DATA 
The CTX program can be executed by invoking the command "ctxata.exe" when logged on to the $ctxp directory of 

the MICS system. The program responds with acronyms of the required input data as prompts for further input; 

where appropriate, the acronyms for the parameters of the desired and interference signals are differentiated by the 

use of suffixed I and 2 respectively. Theses prompts are: 

NI, FMINI, FMI DS!GI, NF: 
N2, FMIN2, FM2 DSJG2, 

where N = Number oftelephone channels in the baseband 
FMIN = Minimum baseband frequency (MHz) 
FM = Maximum baseband frequency (MHz) 
DSIG = RMS per channel frequency deviation (MHz) 
NF = Victim receiver noise figure (dB) 

After the above data have been successfully entered, program execution can begin. The user is prompted with the 
acronym "FS:11 which denotes the frequency separation in MHz between the carriers. Upon entering the value ofFS 

followed by a carriage return, the program will respond with a calculated C/1 value, an I value and the prompt 

"FS:". In selecting the values ofFS, the user can choose any value less than 327 MHz by considering critical points 

on the CTX curve. Program execution can be continued until all desired values of FS have been inputted and the 
corresponding output data calculated. 

To stop execution, the user can enter any value of FS larger than I 000. The system will be returned to the 
command level signified by a "$ctxp" prompt. 

An example of the program execution is presented in Table I.

3.0 Generation of Specific CTX Curves 
To produce a CTX curve for a specific victim receiver equipment type and a specific interfering traffic code, the 
default curve with the corresponding traffic codes must first be produced by executing the CTX program. 
Depending on whether the long haul or short haul curve is desired, manual data adjustments are made accordingly.

MOB TABLES 


MDBTABLES 

The MDB contains information ofCanadian and USA 
microwave systems operating at frequencies above 700 
MHz. 

PRIMARY DATA TABLES 

Primary data tables contain detailed information on 
terrestrial and earth stations (i.e. latitude and longitude of 
the site, frequencies employed, equipment employed, 
etc.) 

Terrestrial station primary data tables have in general a 
one-to-one correspondence with station call signs. That 
is, a particular call sign will retrieve a set ofdata tables 
specific to that call sign. These data tables contain the 
information ofthe station itself as well as all the station's 
links (including antennas, channels, etc.) In the case of 
earth stations, the one-to-one correspondence is between 
earth station and location code. 

The microwave primary data is stored in 3 main tables; 

mt site which contains all site records; 
mt ante which contains all antenna records and 
mt chan which contains all channel records. 

For earth stations the tables in the MDB are the 
following: 

me site table which contains all site records; 
me_ante table which contains all antenna records; 
me_azim table which contains all azimuth records and 
me_chan table which contains all channel records. 

The MICS programs, whenever required, access 
automatically the appropriate table, without user 
intervention. 

SUBSIDIARY DATA TABLES 

The subsidiary data tables are not associated to any 
station in particular. They contain descriptive 
information and numerical data used in interference 
calculations and record keeping. The following are the

ADMINISTRATION OF THE MDB 

The administration ofthe mdb, resides in the FCSA 
central staff group. Within this group there is a Database 
Administrator (DBA) and the DBA is currently the only 
one who can introduce changes into the databases. This 
is valid for both, the primary and most of the subsidiary 
information in the database. 

For updating the database, the DBA uses manual checks, 
followed by the validation program, for primary and 
subsidiary data (pdfand sdfVALIDATE), which is the 
same program the members use, and then the MDB 
update program ( called UPDATE in MICS), which posts 
primary and subsidiary information to the appropriate 
tables. Only the DBA is allowed to use update.

DIRECTORIES AND FILES Page 1 of2 

DIRECTORIES & FILES 


All data in the MICS computer system, with the 
exception of data contained in databases, are stored in 
files. Files are grouped together in directories. 
Directories can be classified in different types, according 
to the privileges or access restrictions associated with 
them. 

There are four different privileges that a user may have 
over a directory or a file. 

Read the right to examine, list, or copy a file or files 
on a disk or tape volume. 
Write the right to modify a file or to write files on a 
disk or tape volume. 
Execute the right to execute files that contain 
executable program images. 
Delete the right to delete the file or files on a disk or 
tape volume. 

Private and Coordination Directories 

Private All MICS users have their own private 

Directories directories, assigned under their users' 
identification code (UIC). The files within 
a private directory can be accessed only by 
the owner of that directory and the owner 
can exert all four privileges on the files it 
contains. 

Coordination All users have a "Coordination" directory. 

Directory These directories are accessible to all other 
users. They are used for example, to 
transfer a data file from the user private 
directory, for other users to copy it and 
execute their coordination studies. 

FCSA Public These are directories accessible to all users 
Directories and are used by FCSA to transfer data to 
the users. 

Types of Files

THE DATABASE 

Primary and subsidiary information can be retrieved 
from the mdb by using MICS programs. 

Retrieval of Primary Data 

Primary data can be retrieved from the mdb by selecting 
the "Create PDF from MDB" option, under "PDF 
Functions." The user has several culling options, to 
select that part of the database of his or her interest ( e.g. 
by call sign, or by pair of call signs, etc.). For more 
details on how to operate these functions, see the PDF 
Functions section of the MICS User Guide. 

Retrieval of Subsidiary Data 

Subsidiary data can be retrieved from the sd tables by 
selecting the "Create SDF from SDB" option, under 
"SDF Functions", followed by the section of the 
particular table wanted by the user. 

The user has several culling options, which will depend 
on the particular table selected ( e.g. Antenna Code, or 
CTX table, etc.). For more details or how to operate 
these functions, see the SDF Functions sections of the 
MICS User Guide. 

Retrieval of Data Using Reports Options or Ingres 

Data can also be retrieved by selecting the "Reports" 
option in the MICS menu, or by going directly into 
Ingres. The "Create PDF from MDB" and "Create SDF 
for SDB" functions are more suitable for interference 
analysis, since they create the files in the format required 
by the interference analysis program (ISIP).

INTERFERENCE 
CALCULATION MODES 


Microwave frequency coordination procedures in Canada 
are governed by regulations of the Federal Government, 
in particular Industry Canada. Readers unfamiliar with 
these regulations are referred to the FCSA Frequency 
Coordination Procedures Manual. 

In general, coordination becomes necessary in two 
circumstances (these are called 'PLAN' and 'PROTECT' 

inMICS): 
PLAN When an FCSA member intends to establish 
a new microwave facility, or to make 
changes to an existing facility, the member 
is interested in the interference that will be 
caused by the planned facility into the 
existing environment of his/her own and 
other stations, and the interference that will 
result into his/her planned facility from the 
environment. 

PROTECT After an FCSA member has established 
microwave facilities, he/she is interested in 
the additional interference that may result 
into those facilities as a result of the 
proposals of other organizations for new or 
revised facilities in the same general area. 

Whether under PLAN or PROTECT, interference can be 
categorized as: 

-Between two terrestrial microwave stations. 
-Between a terrestrial microwave station and an earth 
station. 
-Between a terrestrial microwave station and a satellite 
station. 

At the present time, MICS does not treat interference 
between terrestrial and/or earth stations, on one hand, 
and other radio and non-radio services on the other.

OPERATOR CODE in the TSIP Parameter File, 
followed by his or her own company OPER Code) those 
stations considered its "own". In fact, the user can select 
up to fifty "ownoper" codes which will be identified as 
his/her "own" during the analysis. 

The TSIP program, in PROT mode, will select from the 
environment indicated by the user all those stations 
which are considered user's own, and will analyze them 
against all those stations in the new "unknown" PDF file 
which are not considered user's own. 

The interference analysis will consider the effects of the 
PDF stations into the user's stations and the effects ofthe 
user's station into the PDF's stations.

INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS Page 1 of2 

INTEFERENCE 
ANALYSIS 


Introduction 

The main program used for performing interference 
analysis in MICS is the Terrestrial and Space 
Interference Program (TSIP). 

Functions of TSIP 

TSIP can be used for performing the following functions: 

a. Analysis of interference among terrestrial 
microwave radio-relay systems. 
b. Analysis ofmicrowave interference between 
terrestrial radio-relay stations and fixed-satellite 
earth stations. 
c. Analysis ofthe possibility of intersection between 
terrestrial radio relay links and the geostationary 
satellite orbit. 
TSIP is set up to permit combinations ofthese functions 
to be invoked in a single run. 

TSIP Parameter File 

TSIP is executed by submitting a "TSIP Parameter File" 

The TSIP Parameter file is in fact a command file which 
controls the way TSIP is executed. The commands in this 
file are a reflection ofthe options selected by the user at 
the time ofcreating the parameter file. The creation ofa 
TSIP Parameter File is discussed in detail in Paragraphs 

3.3.0 and 3.4.2 ofthis manual. 
PDF Input File in TSIP 

Each TSIP job analyzes the interference possibilities of 

one, and only one, file of microwave station data, which 

is taken to be the "unknown" microwave station data, 

versus several known or assumed "environments". The 
user can set these up by the appropriate commands to 

TSIP . 

. The"unknown" pdf file is prepared bv the user before 

file://C:\My Documents\K1y Weos'lts1p doc1ts1p_ruttct1ons.htrrr 12/8/2000 


INTERFERENCE ANALYsis . Page2 of2 

Tlie unknown" pdffile 1s prepared by the user before 

running TSIP, by creating a pdf and submitting it to the 
analysis ofthe input data validation program. Once the 
pdfhas been validated, it can be used as input file to 
TSIP. 

Environments in TSIP 

The "environments" against which the pdf is to be 
analyzed can be chosen by the user from among the 
following categories: 

a. The geostationary satellite orbit (for TS files only) 
b. Intra-system interference in the unknown file (for 
TS files only) 
c. TheTSMDB 
d. The ES MDB (for TS files only) 
e. Other pdf's 
The geostationary satellite orbit is defined implicitly in 
the mathematics ofthe TSORB branches ofTSIP. It is 
assumed that satellites can be located anywhere in the 
orbit, and no account is taken ofactual satellite locations. 

The other environments are defined by station data files 
that are in pdfformat.

FREQUENCY -SENSITIVE INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS OPTION Page I of2 

FREQUENCY


SENSITIVE 

INTERFERENCE 


ANALYSIS OPTIONS 

There are three different frequency-sensitive interference 
analysis options in TSIP TS-TS: 

Band, Channel and Plan Analysis. 

In TSIP TS-ES analysis the options are Band and 

Channel, since there are no frequency plans in the ES 

PDF. 

Band Analysis 

Band analysis is a worst-case interference analysis. It is 
intended for the guidance of system designers in the 
early stages of system layout. It is a preliminary step that 
can aid the designer in the selection of sites, frequency 
band, frequency plan, polarizations, type of antenna, 
transmitter powers required, traffic types and equipment 
types for a projected system. When all these have been 
selected a P/C analysis can be performed to prove in the 
design. 

In Band analysis the stations are assumed to operate on 
any frequency within their respective frequency bands, 
using any traffic or equipment. The carrier-tointerference 
ratio (C/I) calculated under these 
assumptions is checked against a worst-case 
requirement. 

No matter which frequency-sensitive analysis option is 
chosen by the user, the program always performs a Band 
analysis on every pair of stations. 

In the TS-TS case, if the option selected is Band 
analysis, all cases which do not meet preset requirements 
will be reported. If the option selected is other than 
Band, no reporting takes place at the Band analysis level. 

Channel Analysis 

In Channel analysis the stations are assumed to be using 
the frequencies, power levels, traffic types and 

file://C:\My Documents\My Webs\tsip doc\freq___sens.htm 

12/8/2000 


FREQUENCY -SENSITIVE INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS OPTION Page2 of2 

equipment's defined in their respective channel records. 
Calculated C/I' s or I levels are compared to requirements 
obtained from pertinent CTX tables. 

When the selected analysis mode is Channel, all 
combinations of stations are first subjected to Band 
analysis. Those interference cases which do not meet 
requirements in Band analysis are subjected to Channel 
analysis. 

Channel analysis is useful for determining whether a 
channel will interfere with other channels that exist or 
are currently planned. 

In TSIP Channel analysis, the user has the option to 
select active or planned channels, via the channel status 
code. Note that the status code(s) selected refer to the 
MDB and not to the PDF. For example, if the user 
selects status codes 4 and 5, TSIP will select only those 
MDB channels whose status codes are 4 or 5, regardless 
of the status codes ofthe channels in the PDF. 

Plan Analysis 

Plan analysis is similar to channel analysis in terms of 
the parameters used in the analysis, e.g. power levels, 
traffic types, equipment's, etc. The difference is that in 
the PDF submitted to analysis, the user needs to enter 
only one channel record (for the same pair of stations, 
frequency band and antenna) and the desired frequency 
plan. If the user submits this file to interference analysis 
in Plan mode, TSIP will analyze all the channels 
belonging to the frequency plan indicated In the PDF. 
The parameters of the channel records (not included in 
the PDF) will be those of the fust channel record having 
the same keys (i.e. local and remote call signs, antenna 
number and frequency band). Note that in this case the 
"Plan mode refers to the PDF. TSIP will analyze the PDF 
channels against existing channel records in the MD B.

SELECTION OF 
STATIONS FOR 

INTERFERENCE 
ANALYSIS IN TS-TS 
AND TS-ES 


Radio stations in MICS are submitted to interference 
analysis in pairs. One of the stations of each pair is taken 
from the file under study and the other from the specified 
environment . Both files are determined by the user 
(according to the specified TSIP parameter file). Once 
the pdf and environment are specified, station pairs are 
selected for further analysis if they meet all the following 
basic criteria: 

-call sign 
-operator's code 
-coordination distance 
-frequency band 
-country 

Interference Analysis and Call Sign 

A pair of stations can be submitted to analysis only if the 
call signs of the two ends of the microwave links are 
different. That means that the program will not analyze a 
link against its~lf. 

Interference Analysis and Operator's Code 

As it is explained in Section 2, the user can select the 

operator codes to execute TSIP either in plan or in 

protect mode. 

-In PLAN mode the user will run his or her file against 
all operators in the environment. 

-In PROTECT mode only those stations in the 
environment which are identified as the user's own 
will be considered vs. all stations which are not user's 
own in the pdf (by inputting the operator codes in the 
parameter file the user identifies which operator 
codes are to be considered the user's "own" in the 
analysis). 

Interference Analysis and Coordination Distance 

file://C:\My Documents\My Webs\tsip doc\stat_int_anal_ts_es.htm 2/13/2001 


For FCSA Members only Page2 of2 

Station pairs are submitted to analysis only if the 
distance separating the two stations is equal or less than 
a given coordination distance. The user has the option of 
specifying that distance. 

For terrestrial stations the user can specify any value up 
to 500 km. Ifno value is specified the program will use 
200km. 

For earth stations the user has to specify two distances: 
the coordination distance assuming tropospheric 
propagation and the coordination distance assuming 
precipitation scatter. For both distances the user can 
select any number up to 999 km. Default value is 500 
km. 

The coordination distance must be used with judgement. 
Many factors, e.g. frequency band, site altitude, etc., may 
determine potential interference between two sites. Ifthe 
user has no instructions from the design engineer TSIP 
default values should be used. 

Interference Analysis and Frequency Band 

Station pairs are submitted to analysis only if they have 
at least one frequency band in common, or a pair of 
adjacent frequency bands, as defined by the band 
adjacency codes in the band subsidiary table. 

Either in the same or in adjacent bands, TSIP is set to 
analyze up to a maximum frequency separation of 300 
MHz (but the user has the option to select the maximum 
frequency separation). 

Interference Analysis and Country 

The TSIP parameter-file creation screen allows the user 
to select Canadian sites only, US sites only or Canadian 
and US sites. If, for example, the user selects Canadian 
stations only, TSIP will not pass to analysis any station 
located in the US.

ANALYSIS 

TS-TS TSIP Parameter File 

Once the pdf that is to be analyzed has been prepared, 
and validated, (see the VALIDATE section in the User 
Guide) the user has to decide on the mode ofinterference 
analysis which is required and establish the set of 
commands that will control it, i.e. create the parameter 
file. 

There are several commands, selected by the user that 

control a TS-TS run. A discussion ofthem is included 

here, more operational details are given in the ISIP 

section of the MICS User Guide. 

The commands that control a ISIP run are selected by 
the user on screen 3.1.A "ISIP Parameters". This screen 
is reproduced in Figure 3.3.01 below. 

TSIP Parameter File -Figure 3.3.01. goes here 

Figure 3.3.01 

In a Terrestrial station -Terrestrial station (TS-TS) 
analysis, the user has to enter the following parameters: 

PDF Type: This field will indicate to ISIP whether 
the user is submitting for analysis a 
Terrestrial (T) or Earth station (E) file, In 
TS-TS analysis the only valid option is 

"T". 

PDF Name: In this field the user enters the name of the 
file being submitted for analysis. This 
name shall match exactly the pdf name on 
Screen I.I, "TS PDF Maintenance". Also, 
the file has to be valid for ISIP; i.e. the 
VALIDATE status code (right column on 
screen 1.1) has to be "U", "T" or "S". If 
this is not the case TSIP will report an 
error condition. 

Env File The cursor will go to this field only ifthe 
Name: Env File Type selected above is PDF _TS. 

file://C:\My Documents\My Webs\tsip doc\ts_stat_interf_anal.htm 2/13/2001 


For FCSA Members only Page 2 of 5 
The user will enter the environment file 

name. This name shall match exactly the 
name of the TS file on Screen 1.1 and the 
file has to be valid for TSIP (i.e. status U, 
Tor S). 

TSORB This field will indicate to TSIP ifthe user 

Cale?: wants to execute an "Orbit Intersection 
analysis" (see section 3.5). The default 
value in this field is "N", that means TSIP 
will not perform an orbit intersection 
analysis unless the user changes it to "Y". 

Propagation The user has 4 options, # 1 to # 5. Option 

Loss Mode#: #1 is CCIR-SJM model, #2 are spherical 
earth model, #3 are Free space, #4 are 
PCS-HATA model and #5 is OH-Loss. 
The algorithms used in these calculations 
are discussed in section 3.3.3. 

Max. Freq. In this field the user selects the maximum 

Separation frequency separation (between interfering 
and victim carrier frequencies) to be used 
in the TSIP analysis. TSIP will use the 
figure entered by the user if the distance 
between the interfering and victim stations 
is greater than one half of the selected 
coordination distance. If the distance 
between the interfering and victim stations 
is equal or less then one half of the 
selected coordination distance, TSIP will 
default to the greater of: 

-the value entered by the user and 300 
MHz, if the interfering and victim 
traffic codes are not PCS codes; 

-the value entered by the user and 150 
MHz, ifthe interferer and/or victim 
traffic is a PCS code. 

The figure entered in this field will 
indicate to TSIP the coordination area of 

Coord. Dist.: the analysis. The coordination area, in 
TSIP, is a circle centered on the TS site 
and with a radius equal to the coordination 
distance selected by the user. TSIP will 
draw this circle for each station in the file 
submitted for analysis. All stations from 
the environment which are located within 
these circles will be selected for further 
analysis. 

In the angular section of± 5° from the 

main beam ofthe antenna, TSIP doubles 

the coordination distance ("key-hole" 

distance) and the status on this sector are 

added to those in the circle.

negative margin values can be entered, 
they should not be used in general; they 
are useful only for special cases of postanalysis 
or for testing the program.

is used, in general, when the user knows of 
a site, or sites, which are potential 
interference cases with the file under 
study. TSIP will look, in this case, only to 
those environment sites selected by the 
user; it will be a limited but faster 
analysis. The user can introduce changes 
to his/her proposed file and repeat the 
analysis against the selected environment 
call signs, which will allow the user to 
observe the effect produced by the 
changes to the pdf. 

The user will enter in this table all the 
environment operator codes he/she has 
selected for this analysis. This could be 
just his/her own company code, for 
example. In this case TSIP would look 
only to those stations in the environment 
that belong to the user (this would be a 
TSIP analysis in Protect mode, since it is 
only looking at the user's stations). Or the 
user could select the operator code(s) of 
companies he/she is doing the analysis on 

behalf of. 

This is a suffix added by TSIP to the TSIP 

tables root name. Note that TSIP writes

results of the first analysis, the ISIP Run 

Name should be changed. 

Report Type: TS-TS ISIP can produce up to 5 different 
output reports, in addition to the ORBIT 
report ifthis is requested. The user has to 
say "Y" or "N" for each ofthe reports, 
whether he/she wants them produced or 
not. The default condition is all "Y". For a 
discussion of the contents of these reports 
see section 4.2.1.

TS-TS Band Analysis 
Calculations 


Interference calculations in Band analysis are based on 
several assumptions concerning power levels, 
transmission losses, interference criteria, etc. All these 
assumptions are discussed in the following paragraphs. 

Victim Hop Receive Power 

In Band analysis no specific RF channel frequencies are 
analyzed by TSIP. Therefore it was agreed, by the 
members ofthe MICS Technical group, to use the 
parameters of the first listed channel in both, the user's 
pdf submitted to analysis and the station from the 
enviromnent (remember that TSIP analyzes the stations 
by pairs, one from the proposed pdf and one from the 
enviromnent). 

The receive signal level at the receiver of the victim hop, 
is calculated as follows: 

PRx = Pwrtx (1) -afsltxl(l) + AGainTx(l) -Path Loss+ 
AGain Rx(l) -afslrxl(l) (dBm) 

Where: 

PRx: Receive signal level at the victim receiver 
input, in dBm. 
Pwrtx(l): Transmit power, in dBm, ofthe first 
channel of the (remote) victim station. 
This value is stored in the pwrtx field of 
this channel record. 
afsltxl(l): Antenna feeder system loss, in dB, of the 
main transmitter ofthe first channel of the 
(remote) victim station. This value is 
stored in the afsltxl field of this channel 
record. 

AGain Tx(l): Antenna gain, in dBi, ofthe main transmit 
antenna of the first channel ofthe (remote) 
victim station. The antenna number of this 
antenna is stored in the antnumbtxl field 
of this channel record. 

Path Loss: Is the propagation loss, in dB, from the 
(remote) victim hop transmitter to the

victim receiver, calculation of path loss is 

discussed in paragraph 3 .3 .3. 

AGain Rx(l): Is the antenna gain, in dBi, of the main 
receiver of the first charmel ofthe victim 
station. The antenna number of this 
antenna is stored in the antnumbrx 1 field 
ofthis charmel record. 

afslrxl(l): Antenna feeder system loss, in dB, ofthe 
main receiver of the first channel ofthe 
victim station. This value is stored in the 
afslrx 1 field of this charmel record. 

Interfering Signal Level 

The interfering signal level at the receiver of the victim 
hop, is calculated as follows: 

I= pwrtxi(l) -afsltxli(l) + AGainTxi(l) -Path Loss (i) 

+ AGainRx(l) -afslrxl -Ant Disc(Worst) (dBm) 
Where: 

I: Interfering signal level at the input ofthe 
victim station receiver, in dBm. 
pwrtxi(l): Transmit power, in dBm, of the first 
charmel of the interfering station. This 
value is stored in the pwrtx field ofthis 
charmel record. 

afsltxli(l): Antenna feeder system loss, in dB, of the 
main transmitter of the first charmel of the 
interfering station. This value is stored in 
the afsltz(l) ofthis charmel record. 

AGain Txi Antenna gain, in dBi, of the main transmit 

(1): antenna of the first charmel of the 
interfering station. The antenna number of 
this antenna is stored in the antnumbtxl 
field of this charmel record. 

Path Loss (i): Is the propagation loss, in dB, from the 
interfering transmitter to the victim 
receiver. Calculation of path loss is 
discussed in Paragraph 3.3.3. 

AgainRx(l) and afslrxl(l) are defined above. 

Ant Disc Is the worst case sum (i.e. minimum) of 
(Worst): the transmit (interfering) plus the receive 
(victim) antenna discriminations. This is

TS-TS Band Analysis Calculations calculated in this way since in Band Page 3 of3 

analysis no specific RF channel polarities 
are defined. Calculation ofthe antenna 
discrimination is discussed in section 
3.3.4. 

Carrier-to-Interference Ratio in Band Analysis 

The carrier-to-interference ratio in Band analysis is given 
by: 

C/I = Prx -I (dB) 

Where Prx is calculated as per paragraph 3 .3 .1.1 and I is 
calculated as per paragraph 3.3.1.1. 

3.3.1.4 Interference Criterion in Band Analysis 
Interfering is defined to exist in band analysis if: 

C/I < 1 l0(dB) 

Where C/I is the carrier to interference ratio calculated as 
per Paragraph 3.3.1.3. 

Ifno margin (see Required Margin in 3.3.0) has been 
entered by the user in the ISIP parameter file, ISIP will 
report all cases whose C/I is less than 110 (dB). Ifa 
margin is inputted by the user, ISIP will report all those 
cases whose margin is less than 1 l0(dB) plus this margin 

(i.e. ifthe user inputs a margin of SdB ISIP will report 
all cases where the C/I is less than l 15dB)

In Plan and Channel analysis specific frequencies, traffic 

and equipment types are taken into consideration. The 

carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I), or the interference 

signal power level (I), is calculated for those specific 

parameters (frequency, traffic type, etc.) and compared to 

the requirements obtained from the carrier-to


interference (CTX) tables. In PLAN mode the 

parameters ofthe "PLANNED" channels are taken from 

the first channel record with the same antenna keys, i.e. 

local call sign, remote call sign, Band Code and antenna 

number. 

C and I Calculation in Plan/Channel Analysis 

Receive Carrier level 


The receive carrier level is calculated using the actual 

transmit power (PTX) of the victim transmitter. 

Therefore: 

C =PTX (Victim) -AFSL (Victim, Tx) + AGAIN 
(Victim, Tx) -Path Loss (victim) + AGAIN (Victim, 
Rx) -AFSL (Victim, Rx) 

=EIRP (Victim) -Path Loss (victim) + AGAIN 
(Victim, Rx) -AFSL (Victim, Rx) (dBm) 

Where: 

C: Receive carrier level at the victim 
receiver, in ( dBm) 
PTX (Victim): Transmit power level at the victim hop 
(remote) transmitter in (dBm). This value 
is stored in the pwrtx field ofthe channel 
record of the victim channel under 
analysis. 

AFSL Transmit victim (remote) antenna feeder 

(Victim, Tx): system loss, in (dB). This value is stored 
in the afsltx I field ofthe channel record 
ofthe victim channel under analysis. 

AGAIN Victim (remote) transmit antenna gain, in 

(Victim, Tx) (dBi). The antenna number of this antenna 
is stored in the antnumbtxl field of the 
channel record f the victim channel under

in the antenna record which corresponds 
to this channel record. 

Path Loss 
(victim): 
Propagation loss between victim hop 
transmitter and receiver, in ( dB). 
Calculated as in paragraph 3 .3 .3 for the 
transmit frequency of this channel. 
AGAIN Victim receive antenna gain (at the victim 

(Victim, Rx): hop receiving site), in (dBi). The antenna 
number of this antenna is stored in the 
antnumbrxl, antnumbrx2 or antnumbrx3 
( whether the case under study is the main, 
diversity! or diversity2 receiver) of the 
channel record of the victim channel 
under analysis. Actual antenna codes are 
stored in the antenna record 
corresponding to this channel. 

AFSL Victim site receive antenna feeder system 

(Victim, Rx): loss, in ( dB). This value is stored in the 
afslrxl, afslrx2 or afslrx3 (whether the 
case under study is the main, diversity I or 
diversity2 receiver) field ofthe channel 
record ofthe victim channel under study. 

EIRP Victim (remote) transmit EIRP, in (dBm). 
(Victim): EIRP = PTX -AFSL + AGAIN. 

Interference level 


The interfering level in plan/channel analysis is also 
calculated using the actual value of the output power of 
the interfering transmitter and actual value of the antenna 
discrimination: 

I = PTX (int) -AFSL (int) + AGAIN (int) -Path Loss 
(int) -ANTDISC (int)+ AGAIN (Victim, Rx) AFSL 
(Victim, Rx) -ANTDISC (victim, Rx) 

= EIRP (int) -Path Loss (int) + AGAIN (Victim, Rx) AFSL 
(Victim, Rx) -ANTDISC (total) (dBm) 

Where: 

I: Interfering signal level at the input of 
the victim receiver in ( dBm) 
PTX (int): Interferer transmit power, in ( dBm). 
This value is stored in the pwrtx field of 
the channel record ofthe interfering

C/1 or I Requirements in Plan and Channel Analysis 
(CTX Tables) 

Interference analysis calculations provide the level of 
interference, I, or the carrier-to-interference ratio, C/I, 
which appears at the input ofthe victim receiver. To 
determine whether the calculated interference level, or 
the calculated C/I, is acceptable, the calculated value 
must be compared with the maximum acceptable level of 
interference, or the minimum C/I ratio, required at the

2/16/2001 


TS-TS Plan and Channe\~lr;ilifu~i.tl~ll.~ffliver. Page 4 of 5 

Interference is considered to exist whenever one of the 
following conditions is met: 

I ( calculated) > I (maximum acceptable) 

C/I ( calculated) < C/I (minimum required) 

Maximum acceptable values of interference and 
minimum required C/I ratios are stored in MICS in the 
"CTX Tables". A CTX table indicates, for a given 
combination of desired and interfering traffic and receive 
equipment, the maximum acceptable level of 
interference, or the minimum C/I ratio required by the 
victim receiver, as a function of the frequency separation 
between desired and interfering carriers. 

The maximum acceptable I and minimum required C/I 
values listed on the CTX's, are derived from 
transmission standards ( e.g. allowable interference noise 
in a VF channel; allowable degradation of the fade 
margin ofa hop) agreed upon by all FCSA member 
companies. More information about these requirements 
and derivation of the CTX's, can be found in the 
"Microwave Frequency Coordination Engineering 
Considerations". A complete description of the CTX 
tables is given in Annex B ofthis manual. 

CTX Tables and Interference Calculations (TS-TS) 

Although a complete description ofthe CTX's is given in 
Annex B of this manual, some conventions or decisions 
made by the program, which directly affect the 
interference calculation reports, are discussed in here. 

CTX Cross-reference tables 


Once the C/I or I value has been calculated, as explained 
in previous paragraphs of this section, the appropriate 
CTX has to be found in the CTX Subsidiary tables. The 
CTX's are defined in terms of three parameters: desired 
traffic (TFCR), interfering traffic (TFCI) and receive 
equipment (EQPR). All these 3 parameters are part of 
the proposed pdfand enviromnent specified by the user 
(the enviromnent may be the MICS microwave 
database). The program, therefore, looks for a CTX 
having the specified TFCR:TFCI:EQPR. Ifthere is no 
such CTX, the program uses the cross-reference, CTX 
listed in the ctx _ xref table. This table is maintained by 
the FCSA Database Administrator and is based on the 
following search sequence:

Path Loss Calculations 

Path Loss Calculations 

Page 1 of5 
General 

TS-TS TSIP includes 4 models for the calculations ofthe 
TS-TS propagation loss and provision was made for a 
future fifth option. These propagation loss calculations 
models are selected on the TSIP parameter file screen. 

The options are: 

1. CCIR-SJM (already in use in TSIP, TS-TS and 
TS-ES) 
2. Spherical Earth (CCIR ,method, already available 
in TS-ES) 
3. Free Space Loss 
4. PCS-HATA (in accordance with TIA Bulletin 
l0G; as recommended by MTG WG's EP and EO). 
5. OH LOSS propagation loss calculations. This 
option includes a digital terrain database, a profile 
builder program and an OH LOSS calculation 
module. 
Defaults are Option #1 for TS-ES and Option #3 for TSTS. 


Option #4 should only be selected for proposed files 
which contain PCS traffic codes (i.e. "PS****" codes). 
Otherwise TSIP will interrupt the run and write an error 
message to the destination file. 

CCIR-SJM Propagation Loss Model 

This propagation loss calculation model has been in use 
in TSIP since its creation. 

In this model free space propagation loss is assumed if 
the distance between transmitter and receiver is equal or 
less than 90(km). Free space propagation loss is 
calculated as follows: 

Path Loss= 32.45 + 20 log d + 20 log f ( dB) 

Where: 

file://C:\My Documents\My Webs\tsip doc\path_loss_calc.htm 2/16/2001 


Path Loss Calculations Page 2 of5

Path Is the propagation loss, in dB, from transmitter 
Loss: to receiver. 

d: Is the distance between transmitter and receiver, 
inkm. 
d is the distance between victim hop transmitter 
and receiver, for the victim hop, and the 
distance between interfering transmitter and 
victim receiver, for the interfering path. 
f: Frequency, in MHz 
Note: In Band analysis f is the frequency of the 
first channel in the PDF or MDB channel record 
Ifthe distance is greater than 90 km but equal or less 
than 160 km, the propagation loss is calculated as: 

Path Loss = -300 + 190 log d +20 log f ( dB) 

(parameters as defined above) 

Ifthe distance is greater than 160 (km), the propagation 
is calculated as: 

Path Loss= -58 + 80 log d +20 log f ( dB) 

(parameters as defined above) 

CCIR Spherical Earth Propagation Loss Calculation 
Model 

This propagation loss calculation method is based on 
CCIR Report 238-6. 

The algorithm used in MICS for calculating the TS-TS 
TSIP Spherical Earth propagation loss is described in the 
following paragraphs. 

Antenna Heights 

The antenna heights used in this algorithm relate to TSIP 
antenna heights as follows: 

The antenna height in meters is read from 

ft * * * ante.aht, when the station belongs to the 

proposed file, or from mt_ ante.aht, when the station 

belongs to the enviromnent. 

HTx = aht(int) + intgrnd is the antenna height of the 
interfering transmit station; 
HRx = aht(vic) + vicgrnd is the antenna height of the 
victim receiving station. 

Transition Distance 

file://C:\My Documents\My Webs\tsip doc\path_loss_calc.htm 2/16/2001 


Path Loss Calculations Page 3 of5 

The transition distance, Dh in km, is defined as follows: 

Dh = 4.123* (HTx0.5 + HRx0.5) 

It is the added distance to the common horizon of the 
interfering and victim stations. 

Spherical Earth Propagation Loss Calculation 

a. Ford> Dh the Spherical Earth propagation loss is 
calculated as follows: 
Ploss= 29.73 +30 * log(Fmhz) + 10 * log(d) + 
30 * log(theta) + N(H,h) 

Where: 

Ploss= tt_*** _chan.pathloss 

Fmhz = tt_* * * _ chan.intfreqtx in MHz 

d = tt *** site.intivicldist 

theta= (d -Dh)/8.5 

H = theta*d/4000 

h = 1.063 *(theta2)*(10-3) 

N(H,h) = 20*log(5 + 0.27*H) + 1.17261 *h 

b. Ford<= Dh the Spherical Earth propagation loss 
is calculated as free space propagation loss: 
Ploss= 32.45 +20*log( d) +20*log(FMHz) 

Free Space Propagation Loss Calculation Model 

In this model free space propagation loss is calculated 
for any pair ofinterferer and victim stations, regardless 
of site altitude or antenna height. The loss is calculated 
as: 

Ploss= 32.45 +20*log(d) + 20*log(Frequency) 

where d is the path length in km and the frequency is in 
MHz. 

PCS-HATA Propagation Loss Calculation Model 

This model is to be used only for the PCS versus fixed 
point-to-point microwave radio interference analysis. 

This model has been implemented into TSIP following 
the algorithms described in TIA Bulletin 1 OG (Annex F). 
The algorithms are described in the following 
paragraphs. 

file://C:\My Documents\My Webs\tsip doc\path_loss_calc.htm 2/16/2001 


Path Loss Calculations These algorithms will be used in MICS for calculating Page 4 ofS 

the propagation loss between a PCS and a fixed service 
microwave radio station. 

Antenna Heights 

The antenna heights used in this algorithm relate to TSIP 
heights as follows: 

-Ifinterfering transmitting station is the PCS 
station, then interferer (aht) = Hpcs and victim(aht) 
= Hmw. The interfering Tx station is the PCS 
station iftt_*** _chan.inttraftx = "PS****". 

-Ifthe victim receiving station is the PCS station, 
then interferer(aht) = Hmw and victim(aht) = 
Hpcs. The victim Rx station is the PCS station if 
tt *** chan.victrafrx = "PS****". 

Note that aht is the antenna height in meters, read from 
ft_***_ ante.aht, when the station belongs to the 
proposed file, or from mt_ante.ah!, when the station 
belongs to the environment. 

Then; interferer(aht) = aht(int) + intgrnd 
victim(aht) = aht(vic) + vicgrnd 

Transition Distance 

The transition distance, Dh in km, is defined as follows: 
Dh = 4.123*(Hpcs0,5 + Hmw0,5) 
This is the added distance to the common horizon. 

Propagation Loss Beyond the Horizon 

Ford> Dh the following equation will apply: 
Ploss= 29.73 + 30 * log(Fmhz) + lO*log (d) + 30 

* log(theta) + N(H,h) 
Where 

Ploss= tt_ *** _chan.patloss 
Fmhz = tt_ *** _chan.intfreqtx in MHz 
d = tt *** site.intivicldist 
theta= (d -Dh) /8.5 
H = theta*d/4000 
h = 1.063*(theta2) * (10-3) 
N(H,h) = 20*log(5+0.27*H) + 1.17261 *h 

Propagation Loss Within the Transition Zone

Path Loss Calculations Page 5 of 5

a. Ford<= Dh and Hpcs <= 60, the propagation loss 
is calculated as follows: 

Ploss= 69.55 + 26.16 * log (Fmhz) -13.82 * log 
(Hmw) + [44.9 -6.55 * log(Hmw)] * log(d) -2 * 
[log(Fmhz/28)]2 -11.4 -alpha(Hpcs) 
(Note: Ploss has been decreased by 6 dB, 
corresponding to the percentage of time variance 
factor). 
For Hpcs <= 9 (m): alpha (Hpcs) = [I.I * log 
(Fmhz) -0.7] * Hpcs -[1.56 * log(Fmhz) -0.8] 
For 9 < Hpcs <=28: alpha(Hpcs = -3.53 + 2.68 * 
Hpcs -0.1017 * Hpcs2 + 1.52 * (10-3) * Hpcs3 
For 28 < Hpcs <=60: alpha (Hpcs) = 25.49 + 

19.92 * log (Hpcs/28) 
b. For Hpcs > 60(m) free space propagation is 
assumed and the propagation loss is calculated as: 
Ploss= 32.45 + 20*log(d) + 20*log(Fmhz) 

OH-LOSS Propagation Loss Calculation Model 

This propagation loss calculation is based on the NSMA 
OH-LOSS algorithm. 

In this mode ISIP will calculate the OH-LOSS between 
the interfering and victims sites using the OH-LOSS 
program and digital topographic database and will 
report: FSL loss, 80.00% loss and 99.99% loss (the 80.00 
and 99.99% values are for 95.00% confidence factor). 
With these loss figures ISIP will calculate the 
corresponding margins and will report a case if any of 
the 3 margins is less than the specified margin for the 
ISIP run (the default case is to report a case if any of the 
3 margins is less than 0). In accordance with the interim 
MTG agreement, the requirement for 99.99% of the time 
is relaxed by IO dB with respect to the interference 
requirement derived from the CTX.

Antenna Consideration in TS-TS Analysis Page 1 of3 

~-~. '-f

Antenna Considerations 
in TS-TS Analysis 


Three antenna system parameters are required in TSIP 

TS-TS interference calculations: maximum antenna gain, 

antenna feeder system loss and antenna discrimination 

( considering polarization of interfering and victim 

channels). 

-The maximum antenna gain is obtained from the 
antenna subsidiary tables (see Annex B). The 
proposed pdf and environment contain the MICS 
antenna codes of the antennas used at the interfering 
and victim stations. With these codes the program 
finds the appropriate antenna subsidiary record. 
These tables have stored the maximum gain and 
antenna patterns (i.e. antenna gain, in dB, vs. angle 
with respect to the direction of maximum gain, in 
degrees, for the different polarization's). 

-The antenna feeder system loss is part of the antenna 
record, ofthe proposed pdf and environment. It is 
subdivided into Transmit and Receive Antenna 
feeder system losses. In the transmit direction it is 
called afsltxl and afsltx2, for the main and diversity 
transmitters respectively and in the receive direction 
it is called afslrxl, afslrx2 and afslrx3, for the main 
diversity 1 and diversity 2 receivers respectively. In 
both cases the allowable maximum value is 99.9 dB 
and the default value is OdB. 

-The antenna discrimination is a function ofthe 
antenna pattern, considering polarization ofvictim 
and interfering channels, and the angle between 
interfering and victim antenna main beam directions. 
TSIP calculates first the "discrimination angles". For 
the interfering station this is the angle between the 
direction ofmaximum gain of the interfering antenna 
and the direction from the interfering to the victim 
station. For the victim station, it is the angle between 
the direction ofmaximum gain of the victim antenna 
and the direction from the victim station to the 
interfering station. With these discrimination angles 
and the appropriate antenna subsidiary tables (i.e. 
antenna patterns considering whether the channels 
are co-polar or cross-polar), the program calculates 
by linear interpolation the antenna gain ofthe 
interfering antenna in the direction of the victim 
station, and the gain ofthe victim antenna in the

Antenna Consideration in TSdJ~cft&Hlci'f\ite interfering station. 

Antenna Discrimination in TS-TS Analysis 

Total antenna discrimination is the worst case (i.e. 
lowest discrimination) combination of discrimination 
taking polarization into account. The worst case is 
determined as follows: 

Desired Interfering 
Antenna Antenna 
H copolar + H copolar least value 
V copolar + 
H copolar + 
V copolar is total 
V crosspolar copolar 
least value is 
total worst case 
polarization

H crosspolar + V copolar least value 

discrimination

V copolar + H crosspolar is total 
V crosspolar +H copolar crosspolar 

For antennas other than passive reflectors, the antenna 
discriminations are arrived at by interpolation in the 
antenna data found in the antenna subsidiary tables, at 
the off-axis angle of the interfering ray. Ifthe antenna or 
its cross-reference is not found in the subsidiary tables, 
default antenna, "WORST TS", is used. 

Passive Reflectors in TS-TS Analysis 

The TS-TS program can handle links involving passive 
reflectors. For a passive reflector the power levels are 
calculated using a special MICS routine. 

The passive reflector discrimination and beamwidth are 
calculated as follows: 

The dimensions ofa passive reflector are determined by 
the antenna code used. The first three characters are the 
height, and characters 4 through 6 are the width. 

Ifthe third and sixth characters are 'F', then characters 1 2 
and 4 -5 are each two-digit dimensions in feet. Ifall 6 
characters are numeric, however, the dimensions are in 
tenths ofa meter. 

TSIP searches for the two opposite legs on the passive. It 
is assumed that, for each call sign, there is only one 
passive reflector, and that it can have a multiplicity of 
links which, however, must lie on one or the other oftwo 
azimuths. Ifthese two legs cannot be found, the passive 
station is skipped and an error message is written out. 

The included angle between the two legs is determined 
and the passive far-field gain is computed as follows:

PGAIN=20 log (EF AREA) + 40 log 
(frequency) -77.323 44 
Where: 

PGAIN: passive reflector gain, in dBi 
EF AREA: effective area. Is the passive 
height times width times the cosine of half 
the included angle, in m2. frequency is in 
MHz. 

The passive discrimination at off-axis angle OA is: 
DISC=20 log (EFFWID) + 20 log 
(frequency)+ 20 log (sin (OA)) -39.5995; 
Where: 
EFFWID is the passive width times the 
cosine of half the included angle. DISC is 
limited to PGAIN/2. The resulting value is 
used for both copolar and crosspolar 
discriminations. 

The passive beamwidth is computed from: 
ABW = 134.88734/(EFFWID x frequency). 
ABW is limited to 57.295779 degrees.

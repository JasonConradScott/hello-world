1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The intent of this report is to provide a presentation on the general principles used in computing 
interference objectives for dual conversion receiver and a guideline for MICS users to be included in FCSA 
documentation. This supplements the CTX instructions contained in the TSIP Reference Manual. 
The CTXDOATD computer program available for use in the MICS computer system is to be used as the basic tool in computation of the interference objectives. 

2.0 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
To characterize a victim dataset for a radio receiver, three of the parameters that the CTX program requires are the receiver's Intermediate Frequency (IF), RF filter response at ± IF away from the carrier or Specific IF Response Factor, and RF filter response at ± 2 · IF away from the carrier or Specific 2 · IF Response Factor. These Specific Response Factors can be extracted from Threshold/ Continuous Wave Interference Curve, or Susceptibility to Continuous Wave Interference Curve. 
As the name implies, dual conversion receiver has two intermediate frequency stages in cascade and this makes the coding of victim file more complicated ie. which IF to consider?

Note 1: If a user chooses a default selectivity, the program \viii still look for the first two lines in the dataset. The digital victim dataset name is limited to 6 alphanumeric characters. Also, the selectivity data at frequencies above those provided by the supplier must be truncated to 110 dB starting 0.1 MHz above the highest frequency given in the specifications to a frequency of 400 MHz. 
Note 2: The program uses AI70 and AI140 as default values to approximate the IF and Image response of the radio. It is preferred to use the SPECIFIC IF RESPONSE FACTOR and the SPECIFIC IMAGE RESPONSE FACTOR derived from the T/I or C/I curves. It is important to note that AI70 and AI140 are by definition not the same as the Specific IF 
Q 
Response Factor and Specific Image Response Factor. AI70 and AI140 are based on the response of the RF filter alone. The Specific Factors are based on the overall response of the radio. The CTXDOATD program adds 20 dB to AI70 for the mixer attenuation to derive the Specific IF Response Factor. 
RF Filter Response and Threshold / Continuous Wave Interference Susceptibility Curves are available 
within the manufacturer's specifications. Susceptibility to CW/ Modulated Interference Data is required to 
determine the specific IF and image response factors and to create the victim dataset.

Figure 1 This figure shows a simplified block diagram of a typical dual conversion receiver. 
Toe responses of concern are the image, and IF. These all are sensitive to receiver filter characteristics and are descripted in the following sections. 
4.1 Image Response 
Image response is the receiver's response to a mixing phenomenon where an interference frequency is mixed with the local oscillator (LO) to produce an interference spectrum similar to the intermediate frequency at the intermediate frequency (IF) stage. For receivers with a single IF stage, the interference frequency is F, ± 2 IF (where F, denotes the victim receive RF frequency), and the image response is limited by the RF filter selectivity at that frequency. On the other hand, image response for dual conversion receivers is more complex due to the additional IF stage. 
96 09 20 Network Standard 
According to Case Studies I through 4 in Appendix I, the frequencies that can produce an interference 
Q 
spectrum at the second Intermediate frequency (IF2) are: 
L01 < Fe and L02 > IF 1  I LO,< Fe and L02 < IF,  LO,> Fe and L02 > IF 1  I L01 > Fe and L02 < IF,  
I)  Fc-21F1  Fc+21F1

iii)  Fc-2L02  Fc+2L02  
iv)  F, -(IF,+ IFi)  Fe+ (IF1 + IF2)  
v)  F, -(IF1 -IF,)  F, + (IF1 -IF,)

where IF1 is the first intermediate frequency, L01 is the first local oscillator frequency, and L02 is the second local oscillator frequency. 
i) When mixed with LO 1, an interference spectrum similar to IF 1 at the IF, stage is produced. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the RF filter response. 
ii) and iii) When mixed with L01, an interference spectrum at the IF1 stage is produced, which can be down converted by L02• The second order product is an interference spectrum similar to IF2, thus interfering with IF2•.The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response ofthe RF filter, and the first IF filter. 
iv) and v) When mixed with L01, an interference spectrum similar to IF2 at the IF1 stage is produced, which can be down converted by L02• The fundamental product is an interference spectrum similar to IF2 at the IF2 stage. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response of the RF filter, the first IF filter, and the second mixer efficiency.

i) When mixed with L01, a 135 MHz interference spectrum is produced at the IF1 stage. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the RF filter response. 
ii) and iii) When mixed with L01, a 177.8 MHz interference spectrum is produced at the IF1 stage. The second mixer converts this 177.8 MHz interference spectrum into a 21.4 MHz interference spectrum at the IF2 stage. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response of the RF filter, and the first IF filter. 
iv) and v) When mixed with L01, a 21.4 MHz interference spectrum is produced at the IF1 stage. The fundamental product with L02 is a 21.4 MHz interference spectrum at the IF, stage. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response of the RF filter, the first IF filter, and the second mixer efficiency. 

4.2 IF Response 
IF spurious response is the receiver's response to a second order distortion product that can create an interference spectrum at IF frequency, with a bandwidth equal to the sum of the interferer and victim bandwidths (ie. convolution of the interferer and victim PSD). The generated second order energy depends mainly on the receiverfront end design and will be controlled if the energy at 'IF' response frequency can be maintained IO -20 dB below the receiver overload point as measured at the receiver RF input port. 
96 09 20 Network Standard 
In the case of receivers with a single IF stage, the IF response depends on the sum of the RF filter response at F, ± IF, and 20 dB. For dual conversion receivers, there are frequencies other than F, ± IF that can produce an interference spectrum at the IF frequencies due to the additional IF stage. According to Case Studies I through 4 in Appendix I, the possible frequencies which can interfere with the IF frequencies are as follow: 
LO1 < Fe and LO2 > IF 1  I L01 < Fe and L02 < IF1  I L01 > Fe and Lo2 > IF1  I L01 > Fe and L02 < IF1  
vi)  Fe± IF1  
vii)  Fe± IF2  
viii)  F, ±(LO,+ IF,)  I  F,± (LO,-IF2)  I  F, ±(LO,+ IF2)  I  F, ± (LO, -IF2)  

Table 3Possible IF response frequencies for dual conversion receiver. 
vi) Both F, and F, ± IF1 get into the first mixer. A second order distortion product similar to IF1 is generated at the IF1 stage, thus interfering with IF1• The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response ofthe RF filter and first mixer efficiency. 
vii) Both F, and F, ± IF2 get into the first mixer. A second order distortion product similar to IF2 is generated at the IF 1 stage. Again, it is mixed with L02 and produces a fundamental product similar to IF2, thus interfering with IF2• The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response ofthe RF filter, first IF filter, and first and second mixer efficiencies. 
viii) Either F, ± (L02 + IF2) or F, ± (L02 -IF2), and Fe get into the first mixer. A second order distortion product either (L02 + IF2) or (L02 -IF2) respectively is generated at the IF1 stage. Again, it is mixed with L02 and produces a second order product similar to IF2, thus interfering with IF2• The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response ofthe RF filter, first IF filter, and first mixer efficiency.

vii) A 21.4 MHz second order distortion product at IF1• The fundamental product with LO2 is 21.4 MHz at IF2 stage (same as the IF2 frequency), thus interfering with IF2. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response of the RF filter, first IF filter, and first and second mixer efficiencies. 
viii) A 177.8 MHz second order distortion product at IF1• The second order product with LO2 is 21.4 MHz at IF2 stage (same as the IF2 frequency), thus interfering with IF2• The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response of the RF filter, first mixer efficiency, and first IF filter. 
5.0 CTXDOATD CTX DATASET GENERATION PROGRAM 
In the CTX model, the image response is accounted for by replicating a double-sided version of the main CTX objective shifted in frequency by 2 IF and by increasing the interference objective by an amount equal to the RF filter response (attenuation) at frequency F, ± 2 IF. A comparison is then made between the main interference objective and the replicated objective over the frequency range 2 IF± IF/2. 
J 
Network Standard 
96 09 20 
The IF response is accounted for by replicating the main co-channel objective shifted in frequency by IF 
Q from the centre frequency and by increasing the interference objective by an amount equal to the sum of 20 dB plus the RF filter response (attenuation) at the frequency shifted by F, ± IF. A comparison is rriade between the main co-channel objective and the replicated response over the frequency range IF ± IF/2. The worst objective is selected. 
In the victim file, it is prefered to use the Specific IF Response Factor and the Specific Image Response Factor derived from the T/I or C/I curves. In the program, the Specific IF Response Factor is assumed to be 20 dB higher than the RF filter attenuation at F, ± IF, therefore the Specific IF Response Factor can be input into the victim file after reducing it by 20 dB. 
For more indepth explanation on the CTX model, refer to the CTX instructions in the TSIP Reference Manual. · 
6.0 DATASETS FOR DUAL CONVERSION DIGITAL RADIO RECEIVER 
In the CTX model image and IF responses are based on the replicated main co-channel response shifted by the corresponding frequencies and attenuated to the corresponding level. Therefore, the calculations for image response and IF response are the same except for the shift in frequency and the level of attenuation. In these calculations, the image and IF responses are derived by comparing the main objective with the replicated objective and selecting the worst objective. 
The separations amongst the possible receiver spurious response frequencies are relatively large when 
Q 
compared to the channel bandwidth, therefore the responses at these frequencies can be processed individually provided the proper Specific Factors are used. By comparing and selecting the worst objective over these frequency ranges, a composite CTX curve is produced for dual conversion receiver.

The CTXDOATD program was executed with the interferer dataset in Section 6.1 against the following five victim datasets. The resulted interference objectives are plotted in Figures 6 to 10. 

6.3 Equipment #1 CTX (composite) Curve Generation 
By comparing and selecting the worst objective over the entire frequency range on Figures 6 to 10, a composite CTX curve is produced for Equipment #I, and it is shown on Figure 11. 
The CTXDOATD program output is stored in a text file. To produce a composite CTX dataset for dual conversion receiver, a spread sheet program such as EXCEL, LOTUS, or SYMPHONY is required. 
Q EXCEL was used to produce the Equipment # I dataset, . The CTXDOATD output files were downloaded from the MICS computer. These text files were imported into an EXCEL spread sheet. Figure 5 shows a sample of the EXCEL spread sheet showing the objectives for one of the IF frequencies. 
The output file contains interference objectives for up to 300 MHz, and only a portion of the output file is shown in Figure 5. Column A shows the output of the CTXDOATD program. To extract the information from Column A, two EXCEL spread sheet functions are used, and they are: 
i) MID(cell,start_num,num_chars) e.g., MID(AI0,3,6) This function extracts substring ofthe cell specified. In the example, the returned string is " 0.30". For Column B in Row 10, the frequency separation, MID(Al0,3,6) is used. Column C, the interference objective, MID(al0,13,7) is used. 
ii) V ALUE(text) e.g., VALUE(MID(A!0,3,6)) This function converts the text argument to number. In the example, the returned number is 0.3. 
To produce a composite CTX dataset with the worst case interference objective at each frequency separation for the Image Response and IF Response frequencies, the MIN function is used: 
iii) MIN(cell_ start:cell_ end), or MIN( cell l,cell2,cell3,cell4, ...) 
e.g., MIN(Al:Fl) 
96 09 20 Network Standard 
When specified as a range, this function returns the minimum value of the range of cells specified. 
On the other hand, if individual cells are identified, it returns the minimum value of the cells 
specified. In the case ofthe example, it returns the minimum value ofthe cells Al to F 1. 
For further information on the above functions, see the User's Manual ofthe spread sheet program.

6.4 Conclusion and Recommendation 
In figure 11, the composite CTX curve for Equipment # I taking into account of all possible spurious responses due to the dual conversion receiver is a very conservative approach. However, to generate such type of composite curve is very cumbersome and is not very practical. 
As it is realized that many conservative assumptions have been made to the current CTX model such as the IF response is based on replicating the main co-channel objective shifted in frequency by IF from the centre frequency and increasing the interference objective by adding 20 dB to the RF filter response (attenuation) at the frequency shifted by F, ± IF or receiver selectivity attenuation remains l lOdB at f(max) plus 0.1 MHz entirely to 400 MHz for the purpose of extrapolation where f(max) is the maximum frequency provided in a supplier's 
curve. 
Therefore, for the sake of simplicity and being practical, it is recommended that the most conservative values for AI70 and AI140 be used by selecting only between the first IF frequency and the second IF frequency for deriving specific IF and Image response factors from either T/I or susceptibility to CW int~rference or RF receiver 
selectivity curves. 
In this case, the (AI70, AI140) at 21.4 MHz having (66.3, 76) is found to be more conservative than the one at 135 MHz which is (83, 95). The corresponding CTX curve using (AI70, AIJ40)=(66.3, 76) for Equipment #1 (interferer) into Equipment #1 (victim) is in fact the curve generated in fig. 6. In summary, in opposition to the composite curve in figurell which is combining the worst CTX calculated values among figures 6, 7, 8, 9 and I0, the CTX curve in figure 6 can be applied with maximum practical CTX values for interference analysis as well as a much less time effort for dual conversion receiver CTX curve generation.

Note 3: It is recommended that Specific Response Factors derived from T/I or Susceptibility curve. be used instead of the factors from RF Filter Response Curve since they contain the combined RF, IF, and Baseband filter data as well as the mixer efficiencies.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The intent of this report is to provide a presentation on the general principles used in computing 
interference objectives for dual conversion receiver and a guideline for MICS users to be included in FCSA 
documentation. This supplements the CTX instructions contained in the TSIP Reference Manual. 
The CTXDOA TD computer program available for use in the MICS computer system is to be used as the basic tool in computation ofthe interference objectives. 

2.0 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
To characterize a victim_ dataset for a radio receiver, three of the parameters that the CTX program requires are the_ receiver's Intermediate Frequency (IF), RF filter response at ± IF away from the carrier or Specific IF Resp6iise Factor, and RF filter response at ± 2 ' IF away from the carrier or Specific 2 ' IF Response Factor. These Specific Response Factors can be extracted from Threshold / Continuous. Wave Interference Curve, or Susceptibility to Continuous Wave Interference Curve. · 
As the name implies, dual conversion receiver has two intermediate frequency stages in cascade and this makes the coding of victim file more complicated ie. which IF to consider?

(fi,ai) -where i=l,2,... 24 are the Frequency Versus Frequency Response Data Point Pairs and are obtained from susceptibility to continuous wave interference curves. Zeros may be used for null data to complete the dataset 
Note I: If a user chooses a default selectivity, the program will still look for the first two lines in the dataset. The digital victim dataset name is limited to 6 alphanumeric characters. Also, the selectivity data at frequencies above those provided by the supplier must be truncated to 110 dB starting 0.1 MHz above the highest frequency given in the specifications to a frequency of 400 MHz. 
Note 2: The program uses AI70 and Ail40 as default values to approximate the IF and Image response of the radio. It is preferred to use the SPECIFIC IF RESPONSE FACTOR and the SPECIFIC IMAGE RESPONSE FACTOR derived from the T/I or C/I curves. It is important to note that AI70 and AI140 are by definition not the same as the Specific IF Response Factor and Specific Image Response Factor. AI70 and All40 are based on the response of the RF filter alone. The Specific Factors are based on the overall response of the radio. The CTXDOATD program adds 20 dB to AI70 for the mixer attenuation to derive the Specific IF Response Factor. 
RF Filter Response and Threshold / Continuous Wave Interference Susceptibility Curves are available within the manufacturer's specifications. Susceptibility to CW/ Modulated Interference Data is required to determine the specific IF and image response factors and to create the victim dataset.

Figure 1 This figure shows a simplified block diagram of a typical dual conversion receiver. 
The responses of concern are the image, and IF. These all are sensitive to receiver filter characteristics and are descripted in the following sections. 
4. I Image Response 
Image response is the receiver's response to a mixing phenomenon where an interference frequency is mixed with the local oscillator (LO) to produce an interference spectrum similar to the intermediate frequency at the intermediate frequency (IF) stage. For receivers with a single 1F stage, the interference frequency is Fe ± 2 IF (where F, denotes the victim receive RF frequency), and the image response is limited by the RF filter selectivity at that frequency. On the other hand, image response for dual conversion receivers is more complex due to the additional IF stage. 
96 09 20 Network Standard 
According to Case Studies I through 4 in Appendix I, the frequencies that can produce an interference

spectrum at the second Intermediate frequency (IF2) are:

where IF, is the first intermediate frequency, LO, is the first local oscillator frequency, and LO2 is the second local oscillator frequency. 
i) When mixed with LO1, an interference spectrum similar to IF, at the IF, stage is produced. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the RF filter response. 
ii) and iii) When mixed with LO1, an interference spectrum at the IF, stage is produced, which can be down converted by L02• The second order product is an interference spectrum similar to IF2, thus interfering with IF2. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response ofthe RF filter, and the first IF filter. 
iv) and v) When mixed with LO1, an interference spectrum similar to IF2 at the IF, stage is produced, which can be down converted by L02• The fundamental product is an interference spectrum similar to IF2 at the IF2 stage. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response of the RF filter, the first IF filter, and the second mixer efficiency.

i) When mixed with L01, a 135 MHz interference spectrum is produced at the IF 1 stage. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the RF filter response. 
ii) and iii) When mixed with LO,, a 177.8 MHz interference spectrum is produced at the IF1 stage. The second mixer converts this 177. 8 MHz interference spectrum into a 21, 4 MHz interference spectrum at the IF2 stage. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response of the RF filter, and the first IF filter. 
iv) and v) When mixed with L01, a 21.4 MHz interference spectrum is produced at the IF1 stage. The fundamental product with 102 is a 21.4 MHz interference spectrum at the IF2 stage. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response of the RF filter, the first IF filter, and the second mixer efficiency. 

4.2 IF Response 
IF spurious response is the receiver's response to a second order distortion product that can create an interference spectrum at IF frequency, with a bandwidth equal to the sum of the interferer and victim bandwidths (ie. convolution of the interferer and victim PSD). The generated second order energy depends mainly on the receiverfront end design and will be controlled ifthe energy at 'IF' response frequency can be maintained IO -20 dB below the receiver overload point as measured at the receiver RF input port. 
CTX GENERATION FOR DUAL CONVERSION RECEIVERS Pages 
96 09 20 Network Standard 
In the case of receivers with a single IF stage, the IF response depends on the sum ofthe RF filter response at F, ± IF, and 20 dB. For dual conversion receivers, there are frequencies other than F, ± IF that can produce an interference spectrum at ;the IF frequencies due to the additional IF stage. According to Case Studies I through 4 in Appendix I, the possible frequencies which can interfere with the IF frequencies are 
as follow: 
L01 < Fe and L02 > IF1  I L01 < Fe and L02 < IF1  I L01 > Fe and L02 > IF1  I L01 > Fe and L02 < IF1

vi) Both F, and F, ± IFI get into the first mixer. A second order distortion product similar to IF1 is generated at the IF1 stage, thus interfering with IF1• The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response ofthe RF filter and first mixer efficiency. 
vii) Both F, and F, ± IF2 get into the first mixer. A second order distortion product similar to IF2 is generated at the IF1 stage. Again, it is mixed with LO2 and produces a fundamental product similar to IF2, thus interfering with IF2. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response ofthe RF filter, first IF filter, and first and second mixer efficiencies. 
viii) Either F, ± (LO, + IF2) or F, ± (LO2 -IF2), and Fe get into the first mixer. A second order distortion product either (LO2 + IF2) or (LO2 -IF2) respectively is generated at the IF1 stage. Again, it is mixed with LO2 and produces a second order product similar to IF2, thus interfering with IF2. The receiver response at this frequency is dependent on the combined response ofthe RF filter, first IF filter, and first mixer efficiency.

5.0 CTXDOATD CTX DATASET GENERATION PROGRAM 
In the CTX model, the image response is accounted for by replicating a double-sided version of the main CTX objective shifted in frequency by 2 IF and by increasing the interference objective by an amoU11t equal to the RF filter response (attenuation) at frequency F, ± 2 IF. A comparison is then made between the main interference objective and the replicated objective over the freqnency range 2 IF± IF/2. 
96 09 20 Network Standard 
The IF response is accounted for by replicating the main co-channel objective shifted in frequency by IF 
Q from the centre frequency and by increasing the interference objective by an amount equal to the sum of 20 dB plus the RF filter response (attenuation) at the frequency shifted by F, ± IF. A comparison is made between the main co-channel objective and the replicated response over the frequency range IF± IF/2. The worst objective is selected. 
In the victim file, it is prefered to use the Specific IF Response Factor and the Specific Image Response Factor derived from the T/I or C/I curves. In the program, the Specific IF Response Factor is assumed to be 20 dB higher than the RF filter attenuation at F, ± IF, therefore the Specific IF Response Factor can be input into the victim file after reducing it by 20 dB. 
For more indepth explanation on the CTX model, refer to the CTX instructions in the TSIP Reference Manual. 
6.0 DATASETS FOR DUAL CONVERSION DIGITAL RADIO RECEIVER 
In the CTX model image and IF responses are based on the replicated main co-channel response shifted by the corresponding frequencies and attenuated to the corresponding level. Therefore, the calculations for image response and IF response are the same except for the shift in frequency and the level of attenuation. In these calculations, the image and IF responses are derived by comparing the main objective with the replicated objective and selecting the worst objective. 
The separations amongst the possible receiver spurious response frequencies are relatively large when compared to the channel bandwidth, therefore the responses at these frequencies can be processed individually provided the proper Specific Factors are used. By comparing and selecting the worst objective over these frequency ranges, a composite CTX curve is produced for dual conversion receiver.

The CTXDOATD program was executed with the interferer dataset in Section 6.1 against the following five victim datasets. The resulted interference objectives are plotted in Figures 6 to 10. 



6.3 Equipment #1 CTX (composite) Curve Generation 
By comparing and selecting the worst objective over the entire frequency range on Figures 6 to I 0, a composite CTX curve is produced for Equipment #1, and it is shown on Figure I I. 
The CTXDOATD program output is stored in a text file. To produce a composite CTX dataset for dual conversion receiver, a spread sheet program such as EXCEL, LOTUS, or SYMPHONY is required. 
Q EXCEL was used to produce the Equipment #I dataset, . The CTXDOATD output files were downloaded from the MICS computer. These text files were imported into an EXCEL spread sheet. Figure 5 shows a sample ofthe EXCEL spread sheet showing the objectives for one ofthe IF frequencies. 
The output file contains interference objectives for up to 300 MHz, and only a portion of the output file is shown in Figure 5. Column A shows the output of the CTXDOATD program. To extract the information from Column A, two EXCEL spread sheet functions are used, and they are: 
i) MID(cell,start_num,num_chars) e.g., MID(AI0,3,6) This function extracts substring ofthe cell specified. In the example, the returned string is" 0.30". For Column B in Row 10, the frequency separation, MID(Al0,3,6) is used. Column C, the interference objective, MID(a!O, 13,7) is used. 
ii) V ALUE(text) e.g., V ALUE(MID(AI0,3,6)) This function converts the text argument to number. In the example, the returned number is 0.3. 
To produce a composite CTX dataset with the worst case interference objective at each frequency separation for the Image Response and IF Response frequencies, the MIN function is used: 
iii) MIN( cell_start:cell_ end), or MIN( cell l,cell2,ce113,cell4, ... ) 
e.g., MIN(Al:Fl) 
96 09 20 Network Standard 
When specified as a range, this function returns the minimum value of the range of cells specified. 
On the other hand, if individual cells are identified, it returns the minimum value of the cells 
specified. In the case ofthe example, it returns the minimum value ofthe cells Al to Fl. 
For further information on the above functions, see the User's Manual ofthe spread sheet program.

COMPUTER-AIDED TECHNIQUES 






6.1 INTRODUCTION 
Computer systems offer the means to store data in readily retrievable form, to manipulate the data, to produce reports relating to all or part of the data and to perform analytical studies. Recent technological developments have reduced the cost of computer systems, and the application of computer techniques to frequency coordination problems has become a feasible approach for many administrations and individual users. Where the amounts of data are large and the requirements foi: analytical studies are complex and diverse, the application of computer techniques has become a necessary approach. 
As the cost of performing manual interference analysis systems increase because of growth in data volumes, the number of complexity of analytical operations, the use of automated calculation systems becomes economically attractive. Computer hardware is now available that includes the processing capability and storage capability to offer substantial performance at reasonable cost. In addition to standard programming languages, it is now feasible to support, in terms of processing and data storage requirements, more advanced software packages which
) provides facilities suitable for management ofdata files need for interference calculations. 
6.2 THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF A COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM 
0 
The implementation ofa computer system should be undertaken if the benefits to be achieved are greater than the associated cost. The benefits achieved usually result from consideration of four categories: 
i) Improved performance ofrepetitive tasks: The computer can perform a calculation or provide an item ofinformation with consistency and accuracy over and over again. 
ii) Increased volume of repetitive tasks: The computer can usually perform the task much more quickly than a human. 
iii) Human released for discretionary tasks: Humans may better utilize talents to work at unique problems or to work at problems requiring judgment. 
iv) Improved control method: The computer procedures impose a type of logical approach and provide a source of information which can improve decisions or judgments made by humans. This also permits improved planning for future operations. 
Benefits may be tangible and measurable such as savings of manpower, savings of work and 
Q storage space, savings of materials and equipment, decreased processing time, increased workload capacity . . . etc., or they may be intangible such as improved management and accessibility of information, better quality of results, improved services to users, etc. 
The costs usually fall into one oftwo categories: 
i) Development costs: The costs ofanalysis, design, programming and testing ofthe system. 
ii) Installation costs: The costs ofpurchasing hardware, preparing the site, converting present system and data and training ofstaff. 
6.3 ELEMENTS OFA COMPUTER SOFTWARE PACKAGE FOR MICROWAVE INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS 
A software package for microwave interference analysis provides an improvement in quality and reduction in time and expense required for maintaining and updating microwave station data and in performing the microwave interference calculations. It should be designed to consolidate these functions in a single, uniform, joint-use computer-based system. The package can be used as a design tool by the personnel engaged in microwave route layout or the placement of earth stations. These personnel can use the computer package to: 
i) Determine, from an integrated database, the stations that exist in the geographical area where the planned facility is to be place, and the interference characteristics of these stations. 
ii) Having designed a new facility, to determine by means of the calculation programs 
whether the new facility will experience or cause unacceptable interference levels . form or to other stations in the area. 
iii) To support a request for concurrence by the other affected users that the proposal is. not expected to cause unacceptable interference. 
) 
iv) To record in the data base the characteristics of the new plan, so that other planners can take it into account when doing their own plans. 
Aside from these basic functions, the program may be extended to support other subsidiary functions. For instance, different users may wish to use the updated-record in the data base as a foundation for the division of revenue or expense among themselves. Another subsidiary function could be embodied in the package by providing a set of standardized auxiliary computer programs for general engineering calculations associated with radio route design and the manual analysis of difficult interference situations. 
6.3.1 System Components 
There are four main components of the system. These are: 
i) A Master Data Base --containing information on all stations that could interfere with or receive interference from planned new systems; 
ii) A Master Data Base Updating System; 
Engineering Considerations 6-3 Fall 1996,

aspects ofall or portions ofthe data files;

The inputs to the system will consist ofperiodic updates to the Master Data Base, as well as user­supplied information on planned systems for interference calculation purposes. 
The outputs from the system consist of report of interference cases and reports of miscellaneous calculations and various catalogue reports. 
6.3.2 Data Base Management Systems 
In automated systems the functions of updating, accessing and reporting data are performed by applications software. The applications software which provides these functions can be either an application related file management program or a Data Base Management System (DBMS). A DBMS permits efficient management of large amounts of varied information by users not 
Q familiar with highly technical management procedures. The DBMS is a package of routines which includes modules used to define records and files of data, to build and maintain such files, to retrieve sets ofdata from the files and to generate defined reports of the data. The files of data are stored so that they can serve multiple applications; they can be linked together through key data items so that unnecessary redundancy of stored data is eliminated. The organization and language syntax of such systems enables a user without comprehensive knowledge and without programming experience to have convenient access to the data. The ultimate objective of a DBMS is to make application development easier, cheaper, faster and more flexible. 
In the context of the microwave interference system, a DBMS comprises the first three items listed in Section 6.3.1. That is: (i) A Master Data Base, (ii) A Master Data Base Updating System and (iii) A Master Data Base Reporting System. These three components should be accessible by the user as well as the application programs. A brief discussion of the requirements ofthese three components is given n the following subsections. 
Master Data Base (MDB): 
The MDB should be viewed as a pool of information with a logical structure that facilitates accessing subsets of data items as required by the application programs. One possible arrangement is to divide the MDB into: (I) Primary MDB and (ii) Subsidiary MDB. 
The primary MDB, which would occupy the bulk of the storage, will contain detailed information on terrestrial radio-relay stations and earth stations. Data will be stored on a station basis, with links form each station pointing to other stations or to satellites. Stations will be identified by call signs and could be sorted based on their geographical locations, or on any other basis such as provincial divisions. The subsidiary files contain descriptive information and numeric data used in interference calculations. Examples of such numerical data files are: 
Antenna Information -Frequency bands and band adjacency information Interference objectives tables -Details ofequipment types etc. 
MDB Updating System: 
) 
The need for updating the MDB is initiated upon: 
i) Receipt of new data from the administration responsible for the overall spectrum management system. 
ii) A successful frequency coordination on a planned new system. 
or 
iii) Upon changing information on an old system 
The updating system should be designed to be used easily by moderately trained personnel. It should also provide an adequate protection against unauthorized access. 
MDB Reporting Systems: 
The Reporting System should provide the user with several reporting options suitable for the varied requirements of different users and different analysis cases. In any case, it is desirable of the system to echo back the input data to guard against any erroneous results. This should be followed by what may be considered as general conclusions of the analysis such as whether or not interference is possible and the interference level. More detailed report should be left as options. For example, the system may provide as an option a summary of all pairs of stations not eliminated by a preliminary gross cull based on distance or band adjacency. Part of the report system could also be a simple data retrieval without analysis. 

6.3.3 Technical Programs 
The fourth component of the software package is a collection of technical subroutines which contain the detailed calculation formula and interference criteria. The analysis process can be divided into two modes: "Plan" and "Protect." 
"Plan": is used when a user intends to establish a new microwave facility, or to make changes to an existing facility. The user, then, is interested in the interference 
Q 
that will be caused by his planned facility into the existing environment of this own and other stations. 
"Protect": is used after a user has established microwave facilities, he is interested in the additional interference that may result into those facilities as a result of the proposals of other organizations for new or revised facilities in the same general area. 
Whether under "Plan' or "Protect", interference can be categorized as: 
Between two terrestrial microwave stations 
Between a terrestrial microwave station and an earth station 
Between a terrestrial microwave station and the geostationary satellite orbit. 
The detailed analysis background and interference criteria for these categories have been detailed in the previous five chapters. 
A comprehensive software package embodies these different categories and modes of interference in an integrated format, and provides the user with the option to select the mode and type of interference analysis as required. Obviously, the technical subroutines should be reached through a procedural program that establishes the required mode of interference and fetches the 
Q 
right data from the MDB. 
In general, the interference process goes through two basic steps: 
Step 1: Technical Culling 
Once the interference mode is specified by the user, and the det~iled data of the desired microwave facility is provided, a gross search of potential interferer stations will be initiated. the culling is usually conducted on two basis: (I) location; and (ii) frequency. In other words, the first step in the interference analysis is to search and retrieve data of potential interferer stations based on their location proximity to the facility of interest or based on their band adjacency. This cross search and retrieval process greatly reduces the amount ofrequired calculations. 
Step 2: Interference Calculations 
Once the required data has been retrieved from the data base the procedural ( or supervisor) program will call in an orderly fashion the right analysis subroutine as required. Auxiliary programs such as antenna patterns or interference tables will be called upon as required by the technical subroutines. 
) 
6.3.4 Program Structure 
Figure 6.1 illustrates a functional flow chart of an interference analysis software package. It represents a summary of the discussion given in the previous sections. 
The first block in the chart (input file) represents an interactive program that prompts the 1Jser with a series of questions and options in order to build an input file. That input file will then be used to supervise the interference analysis procedure by retrieving the required data and calling the needed subroutines. 
The second block represents the technical culling operation. In this operation, stations which are more likely to cause interference are selected out of the very large number of stations documented in the data base. The selection is based on distance, frequency and type of analysis. The operation greatly reduces the amount of calculations. 
The selected stations will then be analysed on a link-by-link basis, and the analysis could be carried out on two stages, standard and detailed. The second stage being needed only in cases where the interference situation is doubtful. 
The last module of the program is a report generation package with several options on the level ofdetails.

CHAPTER FIVE 
CO-ORDINATION OF A TERRESTRIAL STATION ANTENNA MAIN LOBE 
WITH THE GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE ORBIT 
5.1 INTRODUCTION 
5.1.1 General 
In designing a terrestrial microwave radio link, one of the important considerations is the possibility of interference with a geostationary satellite system. When the terrestrial radio link shares frequency bands with satellite communications systems, it is necessary to impose restrictions on both_ systems so that .the interference is not excessive. The CCIR recommends that terrestrial station antennae maintain a specific angular separation with respect to the geostationary orbit or, when this is not practicable, the application of power limitations to terrestrial transmitters involving reception at the satellite. 
) 
This chapter details the geometry of this problem and the calculations of the angular separation between a terrestrial station antenna mail lobe and the Geostationary Satellite Orbit (GSO). It 
also deals with the question ofimposing power limitations on the terrestrial transmitters.

5.1.2 Stations at the Equator 
For a given microwave link between two terrestrial stations, the antenna main lobe of either station ( or both) may intercept the Geostationary Satellite Orbit (GSO). At the equator and for an east-west radio link, the main antenna beams would usually intercept the GSO in both directions. At other latitudes, the interception can only occur in one direction. 
5.1.3 Stations in the Northern Hemisphere 
The discussion in this report is restricted to the interception problem in the northern hemisphere; hence, only one of the two antenna beams may intercept the GSO. Moreover, the calculations steps may be further reduced if we consider only the antenna that is most likely to intercept the GSO. Specifically, the calculations should be carried out for the antenna that: 
a) 
Points towards the equator or; 

b) 
In the case ofeast-west link, the antenna with the largest ground elevations. 


) 
The reason for these restrictions will be apparent as the geometry of the problem is further explained.

5.2 UNREFRACTED GEOMETRICAL MODEL 
0 
Figure 5.1 introduces the geometry of the problem by relating unrefracted (straight) horizontal radio beams from a terrestrial station and the GSO. The terrestrial station site P is located at northern latitude of M degrees, and PL is in the plain tangent to the earth sphere (i.e. zero elevation angle). The different rays represent difference rotation angle directions of true south. The unbent radio rays from P (PYa, PY, PYu and PY') are assumed to lie in the local horizontal plane of the antenna around the local vertical axis at P (i.e. different azimuths). The antenna azimuth angle from true south will be denoted by S. The local horizontal plane at P intercepts the GSO symmetrically at Y and Y', and the antenna azimuths in these two directions are called "The critical azimuths". A rotation in azimuth of the antenna between Y and Y' results in radio rays with fall below the orbit ( e.g. P Yu); rotations beyond Y and Y' result in rays above the orbit 
(e.g. P YJ. 
5.2.1 The Geometric Orbit Trace: E (S) 
The function E (S) is called the Geometric Orbit Trace (GOT). It represents the angle between a line joining a general point on the GSO and the station site P and the local horizontal at P. At the critical azimuths, E (S) i.s zero (in the direction P Y and P Y'; figure 5.1). For any point on the 
o orbit between Y and Y', E (S) is positive ( above the local horizontal) and for points beyond Y or Y', E (S) is negative (below the local horizontal). A general expression for E (S) is given by: (see Annex 5.1).

5.2.2 Above Entire Orbit Condition 
For an observer located at the terrestrial station site P and facing towards the equator, the GSO appears as an arc rising from the east and west and reaching maximum at a longitude equal to that of the observer's. If the elevation angle of the antenna is increased in the positive direction( above the local horizontal) the two possible interception points Y and Y' will move closer to each other and to the G point, hence reducing the range of azimuth angles were the radio rays falls below the orbit. When the antenna elevation angle is equal to that of the point G and GSO, Y, Y' and G will coincide, and the only possible interception point will be in the rue south direction. The antenna elevation angle that satisfies that condition is: 
) K 
E = E (o) = arctan ----(M/2) 5.4 
max tan(M / 2) 
For antenna elevation angle greater than Emax the radio rays will be above the orbit for all azimuth angles and interception to the orbit is not possible. 
5.2.3 Sea Level Blocking Condition 
Ifthe elevation angle of the antenna is now increased in the negative direction (i.e. below the local horizontal plane), the two possible interception points Y and Y' will move away from the true south direction along the GSO arc until they disappear beyond the horizon as viewed from P. At this negative elevation angle and all lower angle, the radio beam will be blocked from intercepting the GSO by the earth's surface. In calculating the minimum elevation angle that 
may cause orbit interceptions, Emin , the sea level is usually taken as a reference for calculating the earth horizon, and Emin is referred to as the sea level blocking condition. 
Therefore, the range of antenna elevation angles, E (S), that traces the visible part of the unrefracted GSO arc is bounded by the inequality:

mm max 
where: e (S) = antenna elevation angle with respect to the local horizontal plane at a 
particular azimuth, S, from true south. 8 min corresponds to the sea level blocking condition. g max corresponds to the above entire orbit condition. 
Later equation (5.5) will be modified to take the radio beam refraction into account. 
5.3 REFRACTED GEOMETRICAL MODEL 
5.3.1 Basic Equation 
Because the dielectric constant of the earth atmosphere varies with altitude, a radio ray traveling 
between two points in the earth atmosphere will follow a curved path. The path will be bent 
toward the earth due to the fact that the refractive index decreases as the ray height above sea 
level increases. If the refractive index is n1 at the point 1 and n2 at point 2, then the ray bending, ,, which is the angle between the tangent to the ray at point 1 and the tangent at point 2, is given by the following integral: 
f 
n2 dn 
't -5.6 ni n tan 8 
where 8 is the angle between the ray tangent and the local horizontal at tan arbitrary point between points 1 and 2; 
and: 
) 
n is the refractive index at that point. 
5.3.2 Refractive Index Calculations 
The refractive index of the earth atmosphere decreases ~ as the height above sea level increases. The lower limit for n is unity (no atmosphere), while the upper limit is determined by local climatic conditions. A typical range of n at mean sea level is 1.00025 to 1.0004. To simplify the comparison between the different values of n under different conditions, it is convenient to express the refractivity as N, where 
N=(n-l)x106 5.7 
Using that last expression;the typical range of N at sea level is 250 to 400. Throughout this chapter, N at sea level will be denoted by N0 and will take three values as follows: 
(no refraction) 
(minimum refration) 
N 0 = !25~ 400 ( maximum refraction) 

For a station elevation of H5 (AMSL), the refractivity N5 is related to N0 by the following 
expression: 

5.8 
At any other height, H, along the ray path, N(H) can be expressed as: N(H) = N s e·Co(H-Hs)

5.3.3. Total Refraction Bending 
For a ray reaching the geostationary satellite orbit the total ray bending can be calculated from Equation (5.6) by substituting:

The Assumed Radio Horizon Angle 
For a radio link between two terrestrial stations, it is often convenient to assume that the earth surface at the receiving site extends in all directions without change. This gives rise to the concept of "assumed radio horizon". More specifically, the assumed radio horizon, Rh is defined as the antenna elevation angle for which the refracted beam grazes an earth-centered sphere at the receive-station height. The definition is illustrated in Fig. 5.2 where the two station heights are 
) 
denoted by H 1(for transmitter) and H2 (for receiver). 
Applying Eqn. (5.13) with the following parameters 
H, = H1 
H = H2 =
00 Rh 0 = 0 
results in the following expression for the assumed radio horizon angle Rh 

where n1and n2are the radio refractivity's corresponding to H1and H2respectively.

In section 5.2.3 a lower bound on the antenna elevation angles that may cause interference with the GSO was established by the sea level blocking conditions, Emin (maximum angle below the local horizontal plane). Now an expression for the Emin can be obtained by setting H2 = 0 in Eqn. (5.15), 
5.16 
Where n0 is the radio refractivity at the mean sea level. Emin, as given in (5.16) represents the sea level blocking condition as seen by refracted radio beams and is referred to as the refracted sea level. 
5.3.4 Refracted Orbit Trace (ROT) 
The geostationary satellite orbit is a circle in the equatorial plane. However, observed from a terrestrial microwave antenna located on the northern hemisphere, is will appear as an arc rising
) 
from the easterly horizon, culminating due south and declining into the westerly horizon. This arc is called the Refracted Orbit Trace (ROT). Each point on that trace can be described by two coordinat(?S: the elevation angle 00 and the azimuth angle from true south, S. A mathematical expression for the ROT can be written as: 
0 0 (S) = e(S) + -c(e) 5.17 
That is, the ROT (00 (S), is simply the sum of the Geometric Orbit Trace (GOT) (e (S)) (given in Equation (5.1) and the associated refracting bending -c (e). The relation between the ROT and the GOT is illustrated schematically in Figure 5 .3. 
5.3.5 An Approximate Relation Between -c and e 
The exact value of-c (e) requires the evaluation of the integral in Equation (5.14). But there are two problems with that expression: 
1) It does not have a closed form solution, so numerical integration must be used. 
2) It supplies -c in terms of 00 note, so an iterative method has to be used to obtain -c as a function of e such that Equation (5.17) is satisfied.

To overcome these two problems one needs at least an approximate function that relations ,: to E directly in an analytic form. Several mathematical functions were investigate. It was found that the exponential function 

provides a good approximation. The first derivative of,: (E) is: ,:'(s) = (3aE2 +2bE + c) • -c(E) The coefficients a, b, c and d can be evaluated by substituting in (5.18) and (5.19) values of,: and ,:' at two known points. 
-c(E1) = exp(aE/ + bE/ + cE1 + d) 
-c(E2) = exp(aE/ + bE/ + cE2 + d)

,:'(E2) = (3 a E/ + 2 b s2 + c) • -c(E2) 
Then, by defining the ray bending, -c, and its first derivative at two points along the ray path the four coefficients could be determined by simultaneously solving the four equations (5.20).

For more accurate approximation of i:(s), the refracted orbit trace is divided into three segments corresponding to three geometrical angle ranges. The end points of these ranges are : -3, 0, +3 and +10 degrees. Thus, the calculation of the coefficients requires the definition of two points 
(s1, i:1) and (s2, i:2) and their associated first derivatives i:1' and i:2' in each ofthe three sections.

The ROT is a symmetrical arc with respect to the meridian of longitude of the terrestrial radio station. The arc can be plotted as a curve in a two0 dimension graph with the following coordinates: 
s: The azimuth angle from true south 
00 : The elevation angle with respect to the local horizontal 
) 
For a certain station latitude, M, and station elevation, (AMSL) H5, the refracted orbit is bounded 
between two extreme curves: 

Minimally refracted orbit = (S) (when N0 = 200)
00 
E2 (S) = Maximally refracted orbit = (S) (when N0 = 400)
00 
The Geometric Refracted Orbit, & (S), corresponds to the case where N0 = 0 (no refraction). The ROT can be calculated as follows: Step 1: Calculated the Geometric Orbit Trace, & (S), using Equation (5.1) Step 2: Calculate the slope ofthe Geometric Orbit Trace,&' (S) using Equation (5.38). Step 3: Evaluate the constant A in Equation (5.28) and substitute in Equation (5.22) ­
(5.27) to calculate the e1's and 1: 1's. 
Step 4: Substitute Equation (5.22) -(5.27) in Equation (5.21) to calculate the coefficients a, b, c and d. · 
Step 5: Equations (5.18) and (5.19) give the total ray bending and its first derivative as a 0 
functions ofe in the range (-3 < E < +10). 
Step 6: Determine Emin from Equation (5.29) and the slope,' at Emin from Equation (5.31) or from the expression of ,'(e) in the range -3 < E < 0. Then use Equation (5.30) to obtain, (e) in the range (e <emin). 
Step 7: , (e) and,' for (10° < e < 90°) can be calculated directly from Equation (5.32) and (5.33). 
Step 8: The ROT 00 (S), E1 (S) and E2 (S) can now be calculated as a function of S by adding E (S) and ,(e) (Equation (5.18)). 
Step 9: The slope of the ROT 00 (S) can be calculated from Equation (5.34) and the information obtained in steps 5, 6 and 7. 
Examples of the ROT calculation are illustrated graphically in Figure 5.4 for station latitude of 50° North.

5.4 MINIMUM ANGULAR SEPARATION BETWEEN THE ANTENNA BEAM AND 
0
THE REFRACTED ORBIT TRACE 
5.4.1 General 
To simplify the analysis and calculation of the orbit interception problem, it is desirable to elevate a computed geometric orbit trace to its apparent (refracted) position and shape. Such an adjustment yields a presentation permitting a given arbitrary-shaped radio beam power profile to be related unrefracted and hence undistorted to the easily obtained configuration of the refracted orbit trace. This section deals with the problem of interception between a terrestrial radio beam and the ROT. 
5.4.2 Reference Points Along the Azimuth-axis 
Three reference azimuth angles are useful in the calculation ofthe angular separation between the terrestrial radio beam and the ROT. These points are denoted by: S(0), S(l) and S(2) , and are 
o 
defined as follows (see Figure 5.5). 
S(0): The intersection point of the Geometric Orbit Trace, E (S) with the antenna elevation angle a 0 (which is represented by a horizontal line in the S -E (S) plane). Using Equation (5.2), S(0) can be expressed as: 
1 tanM
S (0) = cos---5.39

where ~ can be expressed in terms of a 0 as:

S(l) and S(2) can only be determined by an iterative solution. The solution technique for both points is identical and may be described as follows: (For S(l)): 
Initially S is set equal to S(0). A value for E(l) is computed for S = S(0). The slope of the tangent to the E(l) curve at this point is given by: 
_dE (1) E(l) -Rh(!)
= 5.41
dS S(0) -Si 
In general: 
E(l) -Rh (S)Si+I = Si -5.42 
( d ~;1)) 
5.4.3 Minimum Angular Separation 0 
Figure 5.6 illustrates a situation where the center of an unrefracted radio beam intercepts the refracted orbit trace. The unrefracted beam is represented as a circle which is a cross-section of a conical figure of revolution with apex at the antenna site and 2v included angle. If the antenna elevation angle, a0, is fixed, the orbit can be avoided only by an azimuth displacement of the beam. The required angular separation, v, between the orbit and the beam center results when the latter is moved (in azimuth) away from intercept until the unrefracted cone is just tangent to the refracted orbit trace. The minimum azimuth displacement (in one direction) is shown in Figure 5.6. 
5.4.4 Critical Azimuths 
Since the refracted orbit trace is bounded by the two extreme traces E(l) (minimum refraction) and E(2) (maximum refraction), the calculation ofthe minimum azimuth displacement should be worked out on the right and left of these two curves, respectively. The azimuths satisfying a minimum angular separation of two degrees are noted in Figure 5.7 by Sc(l) and Sc(2), and are called the critical azimuths. Note that in the case of Sc(2), Rh(2) (the assumed radio horizon for N0 = 400) bounds the minimum angular separation (i.e.: the minimum angular separation is not perpendicular to the tangent to the E(2) orbit trace).

Sc(2) can be calculated directly from the following equation (see Annex 5.2). 
S (2) = S(2) _ arc cos [cos u -sin a. 0 , sin [Rh (2)]] c COS a. 0 • COS [Rh (2)] 
Unlike Sc(2), there is no simple solution for Sc(l) and an iterative technique must be used. The technique is illustrative graphically in Figure 5.8 and is detailed analytically in Appendix A.5.3. to solve for Sc(l) a new locus of points called Ev is to be calculated. The locus is located at an angular distance v from the perpendicular to a tangent to E(l). As illustrated in Fjgure 5.8, the solution starts at point A (the intersection of a.0 and e(s)). The corresponding azimuth is s(0). Point 2 has an azimuth of (S(0) + v) and the corresponding point on the E1(s) curve is point 3. Point 4 (on the locus Ev) is calculated by moving an angular distance v perpendicular to E1(s) at 
3. The tangent to Ey(s) at point 4 intersect the elevation angle line at point 5. If the difference between the value of Ey(s) at 5 and the elevation angle is nearly zero, then Sc(s) is set equal to 
point 5, otherwise the iterative search continues by subtracting from the azimuth of 5, a value equal to the difference in azimuths between points 3 and 4. 
) 5.4.5 Angular Separation Calculations 
There are two different procedures for calculating the angular separation, U, between an earth station radio beam and the geostationary satellite orbit, depending on whether the radio beam falls below or above the GSO. For a given station latitude, antenna height and antenna elevation angle the relative position of the radio beam with respect to the GSO depends on the antenna 
azimuth, which will be denoted by S0 • As a matter of notation, S0 is said to be south of the GSO when the radio beam falls below the GSO, and is said to be north of the GSO when the radio beam is above the GSO.

must be used as described below: The desired point of E1(s) is denoted by D (see Figure 5.10), and U5, is the angular distance between D and C. The azimuth ofpoint D is S' and the azimuth difference (S0 -S)is denoted by x. To find the point D, we define a function called DIFF (for difference), where DIFF = S + X -S0 For any arbitrary point on E1(s), S', the DIFF function is DIFF = S' + X' -S0 = 0. The technique is based on minimizing the function Diff until we find the desired value of S such that DIFF = 0 = S + X -S0

5.5 MAXIMUM TRANSMIT POWER 
0 
The maximum transmit power of a terrestrial radio station that points at or near the GSO is defined by CCIR REC 406-4. This power is a function of the radio frequency of the transmitter and the proximity of the antenna beam to the GSO. A brief summary of the transmit power restrictions is given below. 
5.5.1 Frequency Band 1 to 10 GHz 
In the frequency bands between 1 and 10 GHz the power delivered to the radio relay transmitter shall not exceed +13 dBW, and the maximum value of the equivalent isotropically radiated power shall not exceed +55 dBW. As far as practicable, sites for new transmitting stations, employing maximum values of equivalent isotropically radiated power exceeding +35 dBW should be selected so that the direction of maximum radiation of any antenna will be at least 2 degrees away from the geostationary satellite orbit. If in a particular case this should prove impractical, the maximum values of equivalent isotropically radiated power for each transmitter shall not exceed: 
+47 dBW for any antenna beam directed within 0.5 degrees of the geostationary satellite 
o 
orbit. 
+47 to +55 dBW, on a linear scale (8 dB per angular degree, for any antenna beam directed between 0.5 arid 1.5 degrees ofthe geostationary satellite orbit. 
5.5.2 Frequency Band 10 to 15 GHz 
In the frequency bands between 10 and 15 GHz the power delivered to the antenna input of any radio relay transmitter shall not exceed +10 dBW. The maximum value of the equivalent isotropically radiated power of any such radio relay transmit shall note exceed +55 dBW. As far as practicable, sites for transmitting stations, employing maximum values of equivalent isotropically radiated power exceeding +45 dBW should be selected so that the direction .of maximum radiation of any antenna will be at least 1.5 degrees away from the geostationary satellite orbit. 
5.5.3 Frequency Band above 15 GHz 
in the frequency bands above 15 GHz the power to the antenna input of a radio relay transmitter shall not exceed +10 dBW. The maximum value of the equivalent isotropically radiated power of any radio relay transmitter shall in aU cases not exceed +55 dBW and there is no restrictions as to the direction ofmaximum radiation.

5.6 OVERALL PROCEDURE FOR INTERFERENCE PREDICTION 
0 
This section summarizes the procedure for predicting possible interference from a terrestrial radio station to the GSO. The procedure can be divided into four parts: 
i) Preparation ofthe radio link data. 
ii) Calculations ofthe refracted orbit trace. 
iii) Calculations of the angular separation between the terrestrial radio beam and the GSO. 
iv) Analysis of the interference prediction results. 
5.6.1 Preparation of the radio link data 
The radio link is assumed to be between two terrestrial stations in the northern hemisphere. The data required on each station are: -Name 
Latitude 
-Longitude 
-Ground elevation . AMSL 
-Antenna height above ground level 
-Distance between the two stations 
Step 1: 
Based on the geographical location of each station (latitude and longitude), identify the antenna that points toward the equator. In the case of east-west link select the antenna with the largest elevation (AMSL). The analysis will be carried out for that antenna only. 
Step 2: 
Based on the geographical locations and the elevations of the two antennas, calculate the antenna · elevation angle, a 0 , and the azimuth angle from true south, S0 , for the antenna selected in Step 1. 
(Note: The calculation of a0 and S from the positional data ofthe two stations has not been covered in this report). 
Steps 1 and 2 constitute the first section ofthe interference prediction procedure. 
5.6.2 Calculation of the Refracted Orbit Trace 
T]:ie steps required to calculate the refracted orbit trace are detailed in section 5 .3. 7. The objective ofthis part is to calculate: 
i) The maximally refracted orbit trace E2(S) (No = 400) and its slope. 
ii) The minimally refracted orbit trace E1 (S) (No = 250) and its slope. 
iii) The maximally refracted assumed radio horizon Rh(2). 
iv) The minimally refracted assumed radio horizon Rh(l). 
These four parameters are functions of: 
i) The station latitude, M; 
ii) Antenna height (AMSL), H8; and 
) iii) Antenna elevation angle, a0• Mand H8 are part ofthe radio link data, and a 0 is calculated under step 2, section 5.6.1. 
5.6.3 Angular Separation Calculation 
The angular separation calculation involves the following steps: 
Step 1: 
Calculations of three reference azimuths S(0), S(l) and S(2). These points (which are defined in section 5.4.2) are useful in calculating the critical azimuths and the actual angular separation. 
Engineering Consideration 5 -35 Fall 1996 
Step 2: 
Calculations of the critical azimuth limits: 
Sc(l):South of the minimally refracts GSO trace E1(S) 
Sc(2):North ofthe maximally refracted trace E2(S) 
Sc(l) and Sc(2) define the critical azimuth zone such that an antenna with azimuth angle between Sc(l) and Sc(2) represents a real potential interferer to the GSO. The calculation procedure of Sc(l) and Sc(2) is described in section 5.4.4. 
Step 3: 
Check for "below sea level" and "above entire orbit" conditions. These two conditions are described in sections 5.2.3. and 5.2.2, respectively. 
Step 4: 
Calculate the angular separation between the terrestrial radio beam and the GSO orbit as described in Section 5 .4.5. 
5.6.4 Analysis of the interference Prediction Results 
The interference prediction process, as outlined in sections 5.6.1, 5.6.2 and 5.6.3, represents a mean for estimating the proximity of a terrestrial radio beam from the geostationary satellite orbit. There are several possible outcomes ofthe calculations: 
i) Above entire orbit: This means that the antenna elevation angle is too high(above local horizontal) to cause interference, and the radio beam passes above the orbit for any azimuth angle. 
ii) Below Sea Level: . In this case the antenna is pointed too low such that radio beam will be intercepted by the earth's surface and interference to the orbit is not possible. 
Fall 1996 5 -36 
iii) More than 2° angular separation: In this case the orbit is exposed to the antenna under consideration, but for all possible pointing directions the angular separation between the terrestrial radio beam and the orbit is greater than 2°. This is considered to be an acceptable separation, and possible interference is not likely. The angular separation is usually measured along two directions: 
Along the assumed radio horizon in the direction ofthe receive antenna, and 
perpendicular to the refracted orbit. 
Smaller separation is exhibited in the case of perpendicular direction and as along as this separation is greater than 2° the possibility ofinterference in minimal.

iv) Less than 2° Angular Separation: When the angular separation between the radio beam and the orbit is less than 2°, intersection is possible. In this case more detailed and careful calculations should be carried out to examine the actual radio horizon and azimuth pointing ofthe antenna. Should such further analysis indicate that interference is indeed a real possibility detailed calculation of the EIRP should be carried out and maximum power limitation should be enforced in accordance with the CCIR Rec. 406-4. 
Figure 5.12 represents a flow chart of the interference prediction steps discussed in this section.

In this case, the link points more than 5 degrees north of the No = 400 orbit trace, measured along the assumed radio horizon (the adjacent station's ground elevation. See Figure 5.13). 
The actual radio horizon, if it dips below the assumed radio horizon between the adjacent station and the No = 400 orbit trace, m,ay give rise to separations less than the reported values, but these will not result in intersections for site parameters expected in practice.

CHAPTER4 
EARTH STATION -TERRESTRIAL STATION INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS 
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
The technical foundation of the analysis of interference between an Earth Station (ES) and a Terrestrial Station (TS) are concisely described in this chapter in order to provide a basic understanding of the interference calculations procedure. 
The fundamental concept of the Earth Station, Terrestrial Station (ES-TS and TS-ES) interference analysis is the determination of the interference level from an interfering station (ES or TS) at a victim station (TS or ES) and the comparison of the predicted level with pre-defined criteria which specify acceptable or permissible interference. 
The predicted level of an interfering emission, at the output port of a TS or ES antenna (receiving direction), which is exceeded q% ofthe time is given by: 
X(q) = P -L(q) 4.1 
) where: 
p = transmitted power at the input of the transmitting antenna (ES or TS) 
L(q) = transmission loss between the input and output of the ES and TS antennas which is exceeded for all but q% of the time. 
Engineering Considerations 4-1 Fall 1996 

4.2 INTERFERENCE LEVEL PREDICTIONS 
4.2.1 Propagation Mechanisms 
There are two significantly different mechanisms by which an interfering emission may be propagated between an earth station and a terrestrial station. The first, called Mode 1 by CCIR Study Group 5, is the propagation of radiowaves through the troposphere along paths essentially in the great circle plane between the transmitting and receiving stations. The. second, called Mode 2, is the propagation of radio waves due to scattering from volumes in the troposphere which may be, but are usually not, in the great circle plane. 
Another distinction between Modes 1 and 2 is that Mode 1 propagation mechanisms produce interference which is continuously present. On the other hand, the only Mode 2 mechanism producing significant interference is scattering from hydrometers; such interference is obviously intermittent and short-term with no effect on the long-term performance of the interfered-with receiver. 
Consequently, three interference level predictions should be calculated TS-ES interference 
Q 
calculations. 
a) 
Long-Term, Mode 1, interference level which is the interference.level exceeded 20% ofthe time due to Mode 1 propagation and is designated X(20). 

b) 
Short-Term, Mode 1, interference level which is the interference level exceed q¾ of the time (q :C:: 1%) due to mode 1 propagation and is designated X (q). 

c) 
Short-Term, Mode 2, interference level which is the interference level exceeded q¾ ofthe time (q :C:: 1 %) due to Mode 2 propagation and is designated X, (q). 


To facilitate the interference calculations for Mode 1 and Mode 2 propagation, the world has been divided into "Radio-Climatic Zones" (see section 4.3.1) and "Rain-Climatic Zones" (see section 4.5.7). 
The interference level is also a complex function of several other parameters of both the terrestrial station and the earth station. All these parameters are defined in the following sections. 

4.3 BASIC TRANSMISSION LOSS AND INTERFERENCE LEVEL (MODE 1) 
4.3.1 GENERAL 
The Mode 1 propagation model used by FCSA Members is that adopted at the Special Joint Meeting (SJM) of the CCIR in 1971 which preceeded the WARC-ST (1971). The equations used for calculating the transmission loss have been updated in accordance with the latest issue (1982, after W ARC 79) of Appendix 28 ofthe Radio Regulations, or the ITU-R "Spherical Earth Model", in accordance with ITU-R Recommendation 23.8-6. 
The details of the SJM model are given in Seciton 4 of Annex 10-1 of the Report of the SJM. The model path geometry is depicted in Figure 4.1 (Figure 10-1-13 of SJM Report). While this model might be regarded as conservative in view ofthe assumed effective height of the terrestrial station of 0.581 km above average path terrain, it must be noted that there are cases in Canada that are not greatly different. 
) 
4.3.2 Radio-Climatic Zones 
The basic transmission loss of a path, expressed in terms of percentage of time, is a complex function of distance, fequency, elevation angle of the transmission path and on climate. For convenience of use the world has been divided into three basic radio-climatic regions termed Zones A, Band C respectivley. These zones are defined as follows (CCIR Rep. 382-2): 
ZONE A: land, with the exception of a coastal strip the width of which is either 100 km or that distance from the actual coast at which the terrain begins to exceed an altitude of 1000 m whichever is the lesser distance. 
ZONEB: sea, at latitudes greater than 23.5° (North or South), excluding the Mediterranean and Black Seas, but including the coastal strip defined above wherever land borders and sea at alti dues greater than 23 .5°. 
ZONEC: sea, at latitudes smaller than 23.5° (North or South), including the Mediterranean and Black Seas, _and the coastal strip above wherever land borders on sea at latitudes smaller than 23.5°.

The spherical earth propagation loss model is sensitive to the earth station and terrestrial station antenna heights. The antenna height used in this algorithm are as follows: 
HTx = aht (int) + intgmd is the antenna height of the interfering transmit station; aht is the antenna height above ground level and intgmd is the interfering site altitude (AMSL) 
HRx = aht (vie)+ vicgmd is the antenna height of the victim receiving station; aht is the antenna height above ground level and vicgmd is the victim site altitude (AMSL)

4.4 EFFECTIVE SCATTER TRANSMISSION LOSS AND SHORT-TERM INTERFERENCE LEVEL (MODE 2) 0 
4.4.1 GENERAL 
The effective scatter transmission loss L,(q) ( q:, I%) is defined as the minimum precipitation scatter transmission loss L( q) between the ES antenna and the TS antenna, as appropriate, for all ES antenna pointing angles specified by the ES service arc without regard to polarization. 
The procedure for determining L,( q) therefore consists of determining the precipitation scatter transmission loss L(q) for each ES beam vector(s) as described in section 4.5.1. The minimum L(q) then defined L,( q). 
Determination ofL(q) is given in section 4.12. 
4.4.2 Precipitation Scatter Transmission Loss Equation

The rain fall rate distributions associated with each of the rain-climate zones is shown in Figure 4.5. 
The maximum heights hR of the liquid-rain cells corresponding to precipitation rates not exceeded for four typical time percentages, associated with the maximum rain rates, are given in Table 4.1 as a function of geographic latitude of the location at which scattering takes place (CCIR Report 724).

4.5 EARTH STATION PARAMETERS 
4.5.1 Earth Station Service Arc 
The earth station service arc is defined, for the purpose of coordination with terrestrial systems, as that arc of the geostationary satellite orbit with which the associated operational space station may be located. This arc, therefore, determines the range of azimuths and elevation angles of the ES antenna beam. The service arc is specified by the longitude ofthe mid-point ofthe arc and by the longitudinal variance about the mid-point. See Figure 4.6. 
4.5.2 Effective Gain of ES Antenna 
The TS effective antenna gain, G1, is the TS antenna gain in the direction from the TS to the ES station. 
) 
Contrary to the case at the terrestrial station for which the antenna pointing is fixed, earth stations are generally coordinated for a range of antenna pointing angles to allow for the use of space satellites or the relocation of an operational satellite. The ES antenna gain in the direction of a 
particular TS, therefore, varies with satellite position and the maximum such value is appropriate for coordination purposes. 
The effective gain Ge of an ES antenna is defined as the maximum gain, relative to an isotropic radiator, in the direction ofthe Terrestrial Station for all ES antenna pointing angle defined by all possible locations ofthe satellite(s) without regard to polarization 
Figure 4.6: ES Service Arc 

4.5.3 Off-Axis Gain Determination 
The determination of the ES antenna off-axis gain for a given effective off axis angle ~e is either by linear interpolation of the discrimination data associated with the antenna patter (see section 
2.6.5) or by the use ofthe reference radiation diagram of CCIR Recommendation 456-1. 
4.5.4 Earth Stations Antenna Polarization Discrimination 
Earth station antenna polarization discrimination is not taken into account in the interference calculations. The reason for this is two-fold: first, because refraction usually depolarizes a beam, and in most cases, the interfering signals have been refracted before reaching the ES site, and so the interfering beams do not generally have the same polarization as they did on transmission. 
) 
Secondly, ES polarization must be aligned with satellite antenna polarization and since the TS polarization will not generally be the same as the satellite antenna polarization, the ES polarization will not be the same as the TS polarization, except for the case where the ES is located on the same longitude as the satellite and the TS has the same polarization with the satellites antenna. 
4.5.5 Energy Dispersal E.D. 
It is well-known that in the case of interference between FM carriers, a wanted carrier may suffer the largest interference when both carriers are unmodulated, and then the beat frequency of the two carriers appears in the baseband of the wanted carrier. If either the interfering carrier or the interfered carrier is frequency modulated, the interference noise power is dispersed over the baseband so that the effect of the interference noise power is dispersed over the baseband so that the effect of the interference noise power to each channel is reduced. It is, therefore, expected that the increase of interference noise is prevented by adding a modulating signal to an FM carrier when it is carrying such a light traffic that is like an unmodulated carrier. 
The signal to be added to prevent an increase of interference noise is called an energy dispersal signal. 
The energy dispersal signal is also required for television video carrier. When an FM carrier is modulated by a television video signal of black picture, most of its carrier power concentrates at the frequency corresponding to the black level with almost the same intensity as that of an unmodulated carrier. Even when modulated by a video signal of a whitish picture, the carrier power likewise concentrates at the frequency corresponding to the white level. Hence, the power 

Q of a television video carrier may not be dispersed waveform to a video signal to ensure the dispersal effect. 
As the signal to be added for the energy dispersal, the symmetrical triangular waveforms are considered to be most suitable for either the multichannel telephone carrier or television video carriers. When the modulation index is large enough, the carrier power is uniformly distributed in the band within the peak-to-peak deviation cause by the triangular waveforms and is approximately zero in the band outside the peak-to-peak deviation. 
Since the carrier power distributed uniformly within the frequency spectrum determined by the peak-to-peak frequency deviation values, the carrier power per 4 kHz is reduced by 4 kHz/(P-P) in kHz. 
For peak-to-peak deviations of2 MHz the energy dispersal reduction will be : 
4
ED4 = IO log --= -26.989 "' -27 dB 4.8
2000 
therefore if PTMAX (dBW) is the maximum transmitter power and ED4 the utilized energy dispersal reduction; then, the power transmitted by the earth station in a 4 kHz frequency band is: 
PTX4 = (PTMAX -ED4) dBW/4 kHz 
Continuing with the above example, if the maximum power PTMAX is 30 dBW, then: 
PTX4=30-27 = 3(dBW / 4KHz) 
4.6 REFRACTION 
4.6.1 General 
Radio waves propagated through the troposphere are refracted due to variations in the radio refractive index. While the index of refraction at radio frequencies is very close to unity and largely independent of frequency, its spatial and temporal variations can however be substantial due primarily to variations in temperature and water vapor concentration. 
The theory for the calculation of refractive effects is well-known, however, approximation methods based on more tractable mathematical functions are almost universally used. The most commonly used approximation is the effective earth radius model which allows ray propagation to be considered as rectilinear above a hypothetical earth having an effective radius r or kr0 where 
k is generally greater than 1 and r0 is the actual earth radius. This model is based on the assumption that the refractive index gradient and hence the radius of curvature of the ray is constant. 
The effective earth radius approximation is simple and useful but generally yields poor results for large surface gradients or for heights greater than 1 or 2 km due to height variations of the
) refractive index gradient. The more realistic exponential atmosphere model and the existence of rain cells at heights up to 10 km make it preferable to use the more precise approximation. 
The approximation developed and described in 'An Approximate Height Formula for Troposheric Ray Tracing' by L.E. Volger (IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, Nov. 1971, pp. 794-796) has been used by FCSA Members for computing refraction effects. The constants used for the exponential model atmosphere are: 
N, = 300 Ce = 0.136 
4.6.2 Angular Distance for a Specified Refracted Ray Height 
The angular distance ~ from a station where the initial take-off angle 00 is specified to a point in the troposphere h km above the station (see figure 4.7) is calculated using Vogler's equations (7) and (9) re-arranged as follows:

4.7.1 General 
The geometric parameters of an~arth station are calculated utilizing vector geometry. Therefore any attempt to calculate earth station vectors requires a knowledge of the earth's geometric model and the definitions of the several coordinate system. 
4.7.2 Earth Model 
The earth is modeled as an oblate spheroid having an equatorial radius of 6374.815 kms and a flattening factor f of 1/298.25. A cross section ofthe earth along a meridian is an ellipse whose semi-major axis a is the equatorial radius and whose semi-minor axis, b, is just the polar radius (see Figure 4. 10). The flattening factor is defined as 
a -b 0
f= 4.24
b 
and eccentricity e is defined as: 
e = ..jf(2 -f) = 0.08182 4.25 
While an oblate earth introduces no unique problems in the definition or measurement of terrestrial longitude, it does complicate the concept of latitude. Figure. 4. 10 illustrates the two most commonly used definitions oflatitude. 
The angle \j/ is call "Geocentric Latitude" and is defined as the angle between the equatorial plane and the radius from the "Geocenter". 
The angle 0 is called "Geodetic Latitude" and is defined as the angle between he equatorial plane and the normal to the surface of the ellipsoid. The work 'latitude' usually means "Geodetic Latitude". This geodetic latitude is used as the basis for most ofthe maps and charts. 
The geocentric latitude \Jf and the geodetic latitude ~ are related with the equation:

4.8 COORDINATE SYSTEMS 
4.8.1 General 
The coordinate systems used are righthand rectangular systems. A rectangular coordinate system is usually defined by specifying its origin, its fundamental (x-y) plane, the principal or primary axis (x) direction, and the direction of the positive tertiary (z) axis. Three unit vectors are then defined to indicate the directions of the three mutually perpendicular axes. 
4.8.2 Geocentric Coordinate System -(IJK) 
The geocentric coordinate system shown in Figure 4.11 has its origins at the earth's center and is the principal system to which all others are referenced. The fundamental plane is the equator and the positive x-axis points at 180° longitude. The z-axis points in the direction of the north pole. Unit vectors, I, J, and K, shown in Figure 4.11 lie along the s, y and z axes, and the unit vector U is thus defined by: 
) 
u = 4.28 
Where: ui = -cos \j/ cos "' uj = cos \j/ sin A, Uk = sin \j/ 
\jf = geocentric latitude 11, = longitude 
In the geocentric coordinate system: 
-longitude is measured positively from the negative of the primary x-axis (0° longitude) towards the secondary y-axis in the x-y phase 
-latitude is measured relative to the x-y plane with positive direction towards the tertiary (z) axis. 
Engineering Considerations 4-31 Summer 1997 
Therefore in the geocentric coordinate system: 
I. latitude is positive in Northern hemisphere. 
2. longitude is positive, west ofprim meridian. 
4.8.3 Topocentric Coordinate System -(SEZ) 
In the Topocentric coordinate system, the origin is taken at the observer. In this system (shown in Figure 4.12), the x-axis is directed toward the south point, the y-axis toward the east and the z­axis is directed to the astronomical zenith. 
Unit vectors S(south), E(east) and Z(zenith) shown in Figure 4.12 lie along the x, y and z axes, and the unit vector is thus defined by 
V = v, S + V0 E+ Vz Z 4.29 
V
where: v, = -cos 8 cosµ 0 =cosssinµ 0 Vz=sins s = elevation angle 
µ = azimuth 
The S (south) and E (east) vectors are in the plan tangential to the earth's surface and the 
Z (zenith) vector as normal to this tangential surface is not parallel to the earth radius vector (see Figure 4.13).

latitude, longitude and ground elevation 
-
Since the Z vector in the Topocentric Coordinate System is not parallel to the earth radius vector, vector algebra will be utilized to calculate the S(south), E(east) and distance from the center ofthe earth given the longitude, latitude (geodetic) and ground elevation H. 
The given parameters LAT, LONG, HT are shown in Figure 4.14. 
To find the S and E vectors we proceed as follows. 
From a given point on the surface of the Earth and for a given LAT and LONG generate the vector

The effective scatter transmission loss Ls( q) ( q~ 1% ) is defined as the minimum precipitation scatter transmission loss L(q) between the ES antenna and the TS antenna:, as appropriate, for all ES antenna pointing angles specified by the ES service arc without regard to polarization. 
The procedure for determining Ls(q) therefore consists of determining the precipitation scatter transmission loss L(q) for each ES beam vector(s) as described in section 4.5.1. The minimum L(q) then defined Ls(q).

The earth station service arc is defined, for the purpose of coordination with terrestrial systems, as that arc of the geostationary satellite orbit with which the associated operational space station may be located. This arc, therefore, determines the range of azimuths and elevation angles ofthe ES antenna beam. The service arc is specified by the longitude of the mid-point ofthe arc and by the longitudinal variance about the mid-point. See Figure 4.6. 
4.5.2 Effective Gain of ES A.ntenna 
Contrary to the case at the terrestrial station for which the antenna pointing is fixed, earth stations are generally coordinated for a range of antenna pointing angles to allow for the use of space satellites or the relocation of an operational satellite. The ES antenna gain in the direction of a · particular TS, therefore, varies with satellite position and the maximum such value is appropriate for coordination purposes. 
) 
The effective gain 0 0 of an ES antenna is defined as the maximum gain, relative to an isotropic radiator, in the direction of the Terrestrial Station for all ES antenna pointing angle defined by all possible locations ofthe satellite(s) without regard to polarization 
Figure 4.6: ES Service Arc 

4.5.3 Off-Axis Gain Determination 
The determination of the ES antenna off-axis gain for a given effective off axis angle $0 is either by linear interpolation of the discrimination data associated with the antenna patter (see section 
2.6.5) or by the use of the reference radiation diagram of CCIR Recommendation 456-1. 
4.5.4 Earth Stations Antenna Polarization Discrimination 
Earth station antenna polarization discrimination is not taken into account in the interference calculations. The reason for this is two-fold: first, because refraction usually depolarizes a beam, and in most cases, the interfering signals have been refracted before reaching the ES site, and so the interfering beams do not generally have the same polarization as they did on transmission. 
Secondly, ES polarization must be aligned with satellite antenna polarization and since the TS polarization will not generally be the same as the satellite antenna polarization, the ES polarization will not be the same as the TS polarization, except for the case where the ES is located on the same longitude as the satellite and the TS has the same polarization with the
) satellites antenna. 
4.5.5 Energy Dispersal E.D. 
It is well-known that in the case of interference between FM carriers, a wanted carrier may suffer the largest interference when both carriers are unmodulated, and then the beat frequency of the two carriers appears in the baseband of the wanted carrier. If either the interfering carrier or the interfered carrier is frequency modulated, the interference noise power is dispersed over the baseband so that the effect of the interference noise power is dispersed over the baseband so that the effect of the interference noise power to each channel is reduced. It is, therefore, expected that the increase of interference noise is prevented by adding a modulating signal to an FM carrier when it is carrying such a light traffic that is like an unmodulated.carrier. 
The signal to be added to prevent an increase of interference noise is called an energy dispersal signal. 
The energy dispersal signal is also required for television video carrier. When an FM carrier is modulated by a television video signal of black picture, most of its carrier power concentrates at the frequency corresponding to the black level with almost the same intensity as that of an unmodulated carrier. Even when modulated by a video signal of a whitish picture, the carrier power likewise concentrates at the frequency corresponding to the white level. Hence, the power 

Q of a television video carrier may not be dispersed waveform to a video signal to ensure the dispersal effect. 
As the signal to be added for the energy dispersal, the symmetrical triangular waveforms are considered to be most suitable for either the multichannel telephone carrier or television video carriers. When the modulation index is large enough, the carrier power is uniformly distributed in the band within the peak-to-peak deviation cause by the triangular waveforms and is approximately zero in the band outside the peak-to-peak deviation. 
Since the carrier power distributed uniformly within the frequency spectrum determined by the peak-to-peak frequency deviation values, the carrier power per 4 kHz is reduced by 4 kHz/(P-P) in kHz. 
For peak-to-peak deviations of2 MHz the energy dispersal reduction will be : 
4
ED4 = 10 log = -26.989 ~ -27 dB 4.8 
2000 
therefore if PTMAX (dBW) is the maximum transmitter power and ED4 the utilized energy dispersal reduction; then, the power transmitted by the earth station in a 4 kHz frequency band is: 
PTX4 = (PTMAX -ED4) dBW/4 kHz 


4.6 REFRACTION 
4.6.1 General 
Radio waves propagated through the troposphere are refracted due to variations in the radio refractive index. While the index of refraction at radio frequencies is very close to unity and largely independent of frequency, its spatial and temporal variations can however be substantial due primarily to variations in temperature and water vapor concentration. 
The theory for the calculation of refractive effects is well-known, however, approximation methods based on more tractable mathematical functions are almost universally used. The most commonly used approximation is the effective earth radius model which allows ray propagation 
to be considered as rectilinear above a hypothetical earth having an effective radius r or kr0 where k is generally greater than 1 and r0 is the actual earth radius. This model is based on the assumption that the refractive index gradient and hence the radius of curvature of the ray is constant. 
l:,v t' 
The effective earth radius approximation is simple and usefulj)ygenerally yields poor results for 
) 
large surface gradients or for heights greater than 1 or 2 km due to height variations of the refractive index gradient. The more realistic exponential atmosphere model and the existence of rain cells at heights up to 10 km make it preferable to use the more precise approximation. 
The approximation developed and described in 'An Approximate Height Formula for Troposheric Ray Tracing' by L.E. Volger (IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, Nov. 1971, pp. 794-196) has been used by FCSA Members for computing refraction effects. The constants used for the exponential model atmosphere are: 
Ns = 300 C0 = 0.136 
4.6.2 Angular Distance for a Specified Refracted Ray Height

4.7 GEOMETRIC MODELS 
0 
4.7.1 General 
The geometric parameters of an earth station are calculated utilizing vector geometry. Therefore any attempt to calculate earth station vectors requires a knowledge of the earth's geometric model and the definitions of the several coordinate system. 
4.7.2 Earth Model 
The earth is modeled as an oblate spheroid having an equatorial radius of 6374.815 kms and a flattening factor f of 1/298.25. A cross section of the earth along a meridian is an ellipse whose semi-major axis a is the equatorial radius and whose semi-minor axis, b, is just the polar radius (see Figure 4.10). The flattening factor is defined as 
a -b 0
f= --4.24 b 
and eccentricity e is defined as: 
e = ,Jf(2 -f) = 0.08182 4.25 
While an oblate earth introduces no unique problems in the definition or measurement of terrestrial longitude, it does complicate the concept of latitude. Figure. 4.10 illustrates the two most commonly used definitions oflatitude. 
The angle \JI is call "Geocentric Latitude" and is defined as the angle between the equatorial plane and the radius from the "Geocenter". 
The angle 0 is called "Geodetic Latitude" and is defined as the angle between he equatorial plane and the normal to the surface of the ellipsoid. The work 'latitude' usually means "Geodetic Latitude". This geodetic latitude is used as the basis for most ofthe maps and charts. 
The geocentric latitude \JI and the geodetic latitude 0 are related with the equation:

4.8 COORDINATE SYSTEMS 
4.8.1 General 
The coordinate systems used are righthand rectangular systems. A rectangular coordinate system is usually defined by specifying its origin, its fundamental (x-y) plane, the principal or primary axis (x) direction, and the direction of the positive tertiary (z) axis. Three unit vectors are then defined to indicate the directions ofthe three mutually perpendicular axes. 
4.8.2 Geocentric Coordinate System -(IJK) 
The geocentric coordinate system shown in Figure 4.11 has its origins at the earth's center and is the principal system to which all others are referenced. The fundamental plane is the equator and the positive x-axis points at 180° longitude. The z-axis points in the direction of the north pole; Unit vectors, I, J, and K, shown in Figure 4.11 lie along the s, y and z axes, and the unit vector U is thus defined by: 
) 
u = 4.28 
Where: Ui = -cos \If cos 11. Uj = cos 1v sin 11. Uk = sin \II 
\If = geocentric latitude 
11. = longitude r£.-----__, ____ _ 
In the geocentric coordinate system: 
longitude is measured positively from the negative of the primary x-axis (0° longitude) towards the secondary y-axis in the x-y phase 
-latitude is measured relative to the x-y plane with positive direction towards the tertiary (z) axis. 
Engineering Considerations 4-31 Fall 1996 
Therefore in the geocentric coordinate system: 
I. latitude is positive in Northern hemisphere. 
2. longitude is positive, west ofprim meridian. 
4.8.3 Topocentric Coordinate System -(SEZ) 
In the Topocentric coordinate system, the origin is taken at the observer. In this system (shown in Figure 4.12), the x-axis is directed toward the south point, the y-axis toward the east and the z­axis is directed to the astronomical zenith. 
Unit vectors S(south), E(east) and Z(zenith) shown in Figure 4.12 lie along the x, y and z axes, and the unit vector is thus defined by · 
4.29 
where: 
V5 =-cosEcosµ. 
Ve = cos E sin µ 0 
= sinE
V2 E = elevation angle µ = azimuth 
The S (south) and E (east) vectors are in the plan tangential to the earth's surface and the 
Z (zenith) vector as normal to this tangential surface is not parallel to the earth radius vector (see Figure 4.13).

4.8.4 Calculation of the S, E and distance from the center of earth, given the geodetic

latitude, longitude and ground elevation 
-
Since the Z vector in the Topocentric Coordinate System is not parallel to the earth radius vector, vector algebra will be utilized to calculate the S(south), E(east) and distance from the center ofthe earth given the longitude, latitude (geodetic) and ground elevation H. 
The given parameters LAT, LONG, HT are shown in Figure 4.14. 
To find the S and E vectors we proceed as follows. 
From a given point on the surface of the Earth and for a given LAT and LONG generate the vector

where: = -cos (LAT) . cos (LONG)
Z1 = cos (LAT) sin (LONG) 
Z2 0Z3 = sin (LAT) 
Vector Z is shown in Figure 4.15. 
The E vector is normal to the vector Z and lies on the x-y surface, i.e. E2 = 0. Therefore, to obtain E we take the cross product of Z with the vector V defined as V = [ 0, 0, 1], that is

4.8.5 Distance Calculation 
From the given geodetic latitude LAT and from equations 4.26, 4.27, calculate the geocentric latitude (CLAT) and the distance IR I from the center of the earth. 
For the calculated geocentric latitude (CLAT) and the given longitude, generate the unit vector Ru and by multiplication by IR I we generate the vector R = IR I • R0 in the geocentric coordinate system shown in Figure 4.17. However, the calculated vector R is the distance from the center of the earth to the sea level of the given point on the surface ofthe earth. 
The wanted distance RH from the center of the earth to the point at height H1from the sea level is the magnitude ofthe vector Rh, that is, 
4.35 
where

The vector RH is shown in Figure 4.17. 
4.8.6 Vector derivation in the Geocentric Coordinate System Given the Geodetic Parameters 
Given a station with GDLAT = Geodetic Latitude in degrees GDLONG = Geodetic Longitude in degrees HASL = Ground elevation above sea level ANTH ·= Antenna height 
a vector VD is generated with the following components (see Figure 4.18). 
= -cos (GDLAT) . sin (GDLONG) . IV01 cos (GDLAT) . sin (GDLONG) . IVol 4.36
_) 
Voz = sin (GD LAT) . JV0 J 
The above vector V O has its origin at the point of intersection between the equatorial plane and the normal to the surface (see Figure 4.18). 
To transform the above vector to the geocentric coordinates, the geocentric latitude (GCLAT) 
-
must be calculated by equation 4.26 and the vector Vo is transformed to the vector V c in the geocentric coordinates with the components given by: 
Vex = -cos (GCLAT) sin (GDLONG) Vey = cos (GCLAT) sin (GDLONG) 4.37 Vez = sin (GCLAT) 
The vector V c is shown in Figure 4.18 is the vector from the center of the earth to the earth 
surface at zero ground elevation. However, the elevation of the antenna center is given by H = (HASL + ANTH), therefore vector V c must be transformed to the vector V c', to include the actual antenna height ASL, as follows: 
-----0
V e' = V c + V Du . H 4.38 
Vectors V c' and V care shown in Figure 4.18. 
4.8.7 Geostationary Satellite Orbit 
The radius of the geostationary satellite orbit is taken 42139.5137 km and is located on the equatorial plane. Therefore, given the satellite longitude SLONG and with zero latitude, the satellite vector S is generated in the geocentric coordinates with unit components 
-
Sul = -cos (SLONG) Su2 = sin (SLONG) 4.39

4.9 EARTH STATION VECTORS 
4.9.1 Earth Station Beam Axis Vector (BE) 
-
The ES beam axis vector BE is the vector with origin in the ES and termination in the operational satellite. If coordination is required for more than one satellite position, that is, if the 
ES service arc is not zero, then the first ES beam axis vectro BE 1 is generated using the operational satellite longitude (OPSLO), which is the center of the service ,arc. From the center of the service arc the orbit longitude increment is set equal to the maximum of 1° or Service Arc/9.5 degrees and from one to 19 additional beam axis vectors are generated for every orbit longitude increment (see Figure 4.20). 
4.9.2 Generation of ES Beam Axis Vector (BE) 
) 
Generation of the Beam Axis Vector (BE) required the calculation of the elevation angle, the 
azimuth and the magnitude of the vector (see section 4.8.6). However, the above parameters can be calculated only if the coordinate system of the ES is defined. Therefore, the first step on 
generating the Beam Axis Vector (BE) is to define the ES topocentric coordinate system S, E, Z (see section 4.8.3). The topocentric coordinate system (S, E, Z) is calcualted as follows: 
From the given geodetic latitude (DGLAT) calculate the geocentric latitude (GCLAT) and the distance IRol from the earth's center to the ES, using the equations in section 4.8.4 and section 4.8.5. 
From the calculated geocentric altitude (GCLAT) and distance IRol generate the vector Ro from the earth's center to the ES, see section 4.8.6. 
-
From the anteuna height (center line A.M,S.L.), calculate the actual vector R for the earth's 
center to the ES anteuna center (see sections 4.8.5 and 4.8.6). Vector R and R are shown in Figure 4.21. 
As described in section 4.8.7, generate vector S from the earth's center to the satellite,

4.9.3 Calculation ofES Elevation Angle (ELES) 
By definition, ES elevation angle (ELES) is the angle between the horizontal plan ( S , E) of the topocentric coordinate system and the vector BE generated in section 4.9.2. Therefore, the angle ELES is calculated from the equation: 
ELES = 90 -0 = 90 -ANGLE (BE, Z) 4.42 
Where Z is the component of the S, E.Z coordinate system normal to the horizontal plan ( S , E) (see Figure 4.23) and:

..... --­
ANGLE (BE,Z) = arccos (BE-Z) 4.43 Where BE• Z is the dot product defined as: BE. Z = IBE I • I Z I , cos (BE, Z) 4.44 Where I BE I, IZI are the magnitudes fo the vectors BE, Zcalcualted in section 4.9.2 and section 4.9.3. From the equaiton 4.38, we have that: BE• Z 
cos (BE, Z) = 4.45 IBEI IZI or = BE1 • Z1 + BE2 • Z2 + BE3 • Z3

where BE1, BE2, BE3 and Z1, Z2, Z3 are the components of the vectors BE, Z calculated in 
Q 
sections 4.9.2 and 4.9.3. 

From equations 4.42, 4.43 and 4.46 we obtain: 
ELES = 90 -Arc cos [BE1 • Z1 + BEz • Z2 + BE3 • Z3] 
4.47 
IBEI • IZI The ES elevation angle ELES is shown in Figure 4.22. 
4.9.4 Calculation of ES azimuth (AZES) 
The ES Azimuth (AZES), is defined as the angle between, the projection of vector BE on the horizontal plane (S, E) and the S component of the topocentric coordinate system. That is:

4.9.5 Effective ES . TS Vector (ETRV) 
Between the earth station (ES) and the terrestrial station (TS) two vectors are defined --the
) -­
geometric vector (unrefraced vector ETV) and the refracted vector ETRV (See section 4.6). The refracted vector ETRV is called Effective Earth Station (ES) Terrestrial· Station (TS) vector and has the azimuth of the geometric vector (ETV). However, the elevation angle of the ETRV vector is to the same as the elevation angle of ETV and is calcualted as follows ( see section 
4.6.3): 
From the Longitude and Latitude of the Earth Station (ES) and the Terrestrial Station (TS), the vecotrs RE and RT are generated from the earth's center in the geocentric coordinates using the equation given in section 4.8.6. 
The difference lhl = IRT I -I RE I is the distance in the troposphere h km above the ES, as shown in Figure 4.23. 
Next, calcualte the angle 0 from: 
RE•RT-]
[-4.510 = arc cos .

where (RE • RT) is the dot product of the the vectors RE and RT, that is:

where RE1, RE2, RE3 and RT1, RT2, RT3 are the components of the vectors RE and RT in the Geocentric Coordinate System. 
The angle 0 is the angular distance between the ES and TS. Substituting the values of h and 0 in equation 4.16 of section 4.6.3, the apparent elevation angle 0 is calcualted. The elevation angle 0 is shown in Figure 4.23. 
The earth station horizon profile data is then used to determine, by linear interpolaration, the elevation angle of and distance to the earth station radio horizon. If the horizon elevation angle is greater than 0 and if the distance to the ES radio horizon is less than the ES-TS separation distance, the angle 0 is set equal to the horizon elevation angle since the apparent ray path is blocked by the earth's surface. 
Lastly, the vector ETRV is derived from the vector difference: 
ETRV = RT -RE

4.10.1 Terrestrial Station Beam Axis Vector (BT) 
The terrestrial station beam axis vector BT is the vector with origin in the Terrestial Station TS and termination in the adjacent terrestrial sation (UTS) towards which TS is transmitting. 
4.10.2 Generation of TS Beam Axis Vector (BT) 
Given the elevation angle ELTS and the azimuth AZTS of the terrestial station towards the 
adjacent terrestial station UTS, the Beam-Axis vector BT is generated as follows: 
With center the TS, calculate the components of the vector B in a rectangular coordinate system. 
The B vector components are given by the equation: 
) 
B1 = cos (ELTS) cos (AZTS -90) B2 = cos (ELTS) sin (AZTS -90) 4.56 B3 = sin (ETS) 
Vector B is shown in Figure 4.25. 
From the rectangular coordinates, transform to the topocentric coordinates system of the TS, by 
doing so, vector B is transformed to the required vector BT. 
The vector transformation requires calculation ofthe components of the coordinates S,E,Z ofthe topocentric system given in section 4.8.3 and section 4.8.4. 
The required transformation then is given by the following equations: 
= B 1 S 1 + B2 E1 + B3 Z1 = B1 S2 + B2 E2 + B3 Z1 
4.57 
= B1 S3 + B2 E3 + B3 Z3 where: 
BT1, BT2, BT3 are the components of BT S1, S2, S3 are the components of S E1, E2, E3 are the components ofE Z1, Z2, Z3 are the components of Z 
The vector BT is shown in Figure 4.26.

4.10.4 Effective TS OFF-Axis Angle (TSOX)

4.11 CALCULATION OF MODE 1 INTERFERENCE LEVEL 
4.11.1 Calculation of the Long-Term Interference Level X(20) Which is not exceeded for more than 20% of the Time 
For the given ES-TS distance in km, calculate the 20% basic transmission Joss, 1(20) by utilizing the appropriate equation given in section 4.3.2. 
From the calculated earth station off-axis angle (ESOX) in section 4.9.6 and the earth station antenna pattern derive the earth station off-axis receive gain ESGRX ( ESOX ). 
A 
Similarly, from the calculated terrestrial station off-axis angle (TSOX) in section 4.10.4 and the TS antenna pattern derive the terrestrial station off-axis transmit gain TSGTX ( TSOX ). 
Substituting the calculated values above in equation 4.3 we obtain: 
A A 
X(20) = TSPTX + TSGTX (TSOX) -1(20) + ESGRX (ESOX) 4.58 
) 
where: 
TSPTX is the TS transmit power in dBW, and X(20) is the TS into ES interference level not exceeded for more then 20% of the time. 
The carrier to interference ratio C/1, exceeded for more than 20% of the time, is given then by: 
(C/I)dB = (C)dBW -X(20) 4.59 
where C is the received wanted signal.

more than 0.01 % of the Time 
For the given ES-TS distance in km calculate the 0.01% basic transmission loss L(0.01) by utilizing the appropriate equation given in section 4.3.4. 
Substituting the calculated value ofL(0.01) in equation 4.3 we obtain 
A A 
X(0.01) = TSPTX + TSGRX (TSOX) -L(0.01) + ESGRX (ESOX) 4.60 The parameters are defined in section 4.1.1. 
The carrier to interference ratio C/I exceeded for more than 0.01 % ofthe time is given then by: 
(CII)ctB = (C)ctBW -X(0.01) 4.61 

4.12 PRECIPITATION SCATTER ANALYSIS 
4.12.1 Definition of Intersection Cases 
The precipitation scatter transmission loss, L(0.01), between the input (output) of an ES antenna and the output (input) of a TS antenna for a specific ES beam axis vector (BE) and a specific TS beam axis vector (BT) is geometrically dependent and two cases can occur. 
The first case is that in which a common volume is defined by the intersection of the ES and TS antenna main beams (Main beam -Main beam). This case generally results in the minimum loss L(0.01). (See Figure 4.27.) 
The second case is that in which no main beam common volume exists and the rain cell may be located in the main beam of either the TS or ES antenna (Main beam -Side beam). This case is called Main beam-Side beam scatter. (See Figure 4.28). 
) 4.12.2 Main Beam -Main Beam Intersection --Common Volume 
The method used by FCSA members to determine if a main beam intersection occurs involves the generation of the TS antenna beam axis vectors in the earth station coordinate system to the rain cell height. The rain cell height is defined by the rain climatic zone of the ES (see section 4.5.7). 
The rain scatter propagation loss is calculated using two difference algorithms: "minimum 
discrimination" and "minimum distance:. The calculated scatter losses are then compared and 
the least value is selected. These algorithms are discribed in Annex 4.12.

Figure 4.28: Main Beam -Side Beam Intersection 
4.12.3 Common Volume Geometry 
On the main beam of the terrestrial station BT, derived in section 4.10.2, calculate the distance IDBTI to a point PI with height equal to the rain cell height. The rain cell height is defined by the rain climatic zone of the ES (see section 4.5. 7). The distance IDBTI is calculated from equation 
4.23 of section 4.6.5 
From the calculated distance IDBTI and the unit vector UBT, derived in section 4.10.2, calculate 
the vector DBT given by; 
DBT = IDBTI • UBT 4.62 
Vector DBT is shown in Figure 4.29. 
-
Next, generate the apparent vector EBT, from the ES towards the point P1'. The point P1' is the 
·­
apparent location, relative to the ES, of the point P 1. The vector EBT is generated following the 
method given in section 4.9.5. Vector EBT is shown in Figure 4.30. 
From the terrestrial station (TS), calculate the distance IDBUI and the elevation angle V0 to the point P2. Point P2 is the point where the refracted TS beam has height equal to the rain cell height. The rain cell height is defined by the rain climatic zone of the ES (see section 4.5.7). 
The distance IDBUI and the elevation angle V0 are calculated using equations 4.19 and. 4.17 respectively. From the calculated distance IDBUI and elevation angle V0, generate the vector DBU, in the TS topocentric coordinates system, as described in section 4.10.2. Vector DBU is shown in Figure 4.29. 
Next, generate the apparent vector EBU, from the ES towards the point Pz'. The point P2' is the apparent location, relative to the ES, of the point P2. The vector EBU is generated following the method given in section 4.9.5. and is shown in figure 4.31. · 
From the vectors EBT, EBU and the vector ETRV (see section 4.9.5), calculate the vectors BTR 
and BUR, where: 
BTR = EBT -ETRV 
BUR = EBU -ETRV 4.64

Vectors BTR and BUR have origins in the point T' (see figure 4.32). This point T' is the apparent location, relative to the ES, ofthe point Tat the center ofthe TS antenna. 
4.12.4 Common Volume Intersection Criteria 
The foregoing steps are preliminary to the determination of common volume (main beam -main beam) intersection condition. 
The first test is to determine if the apparent TS beam axis vectors BTR and BUR are below the ES horizontal plane. As can be seen from Figure 4.33, if the points T', P1', P2' are below the ES horizontal plane (i.e. if their elevation angles are less .than O degrees) then a common volume 
(main beam -main beam) intersection is impossible. 
However, if all or some parts of BTR and BUR are above the ES horizontal plane, then a common volume (main beam -main beam) intersection is defined as existing ifeither: 
) 
1) The ES beam axis vector BE passes through the area in space defined by T', P1' and P2' (see 
Figure 4.34). 
2) The ES beam axis vector BE passes sufficiently close to either BTR and BUR to result in 
(a) minimum off-axis angles at both the ES and TS antennas which are less than the antenna beam widths specified for each ES and TS antenna. (See Figure 4.35.); (b) the intersection point is above the horizontal plane and below the maximum rain cell height. 
If neither of the above conditions is satisfied, then common volume intersection does not exist. 
Therefore, the case of scattering from antenna main beam (main beam -side beam) should be 
studied (see section 4.12.6). 
4.12.5 Common Volume Loss L(0.01) 
The precipitation scatter transmission loss L(0.01) for common volume scattering is calculated from the equation 4.6 given in section 4.4.2 with B = 3 dB while r8 and G8 pertain to the terrestrial station except in the case where the product of r8 and the TS antenna beam width is less than that for the earth station in which case the earth station becomes station B (i.e. station B 
is that station having the larger product of distance-to-volume and antenna beam width.)

4.12.6 Scattering from Antenna Main Beams --(Main Beam -Side Beam) Geometry 
The precipitation scatter loss L(0.01) for the case of scattering from Antenna Main Beams (main Beam -Side Beam), is determined on the basis of the scattering rain cell being located at as many as 8 points ( 4 points in each beam). These points are defined as follows: 
) 
BEi Volume in the ES main beam, at the ES or just at the point where the ES beam comes visible from the TS. 
BE2 Volume in the ES main beam, at the minimum distance from the TS. 
BE3 · Volume in the ES main beam, at a distance from the ES that corresponds to the minimum off-axis angle at the TS. 
BE4 Volume in the refracted or unrefracted ES main beam, at a distance from the ES corresponding to the maximum rain cell height. BE scattering cases are shown in Figure 4.36. 
The BT! to BT4 points are defined as BEi to BE4, but with the roles of ES and TS interchanged. See Figure 4.37. 
ES

) 
TS 
Figure 4.37: Scatter Volume in BT 
4.12.7 Main Beam -Side Beam Intersection Criteria 
The determination of the location of each ofthese points is effected using the apparent beam axis vector in the coordinate system of the other station and in the case of scattering from the TS antenna main beam, both BTR and BUR vectors (see section 4.12.3) are taken into account. 
It is evident that if the entire apparent beam axis vectors BTR and BUR lies below the horizontal plan of the other station, then scattering from the main beam is not possible. See Figure 4.33. 
If all or some part of the apparent beam axis vector is above the horizontal plane than main beam scattering will occur from at least points 1 and 4. 
Scattering from point 2 will occur only if the apparent beam axis vector does not diverge from the other station. 
Similarly, scattering from point 3 only needs to be considered in a point exists on the apparent beam axis vector between points 1 and 4 that results in a minimum off-axis angle at the antenna of the other station. Otherwise, either point I or 4 will define the maximum angle. 
4.12.8 Main Beam Scattering Loss, L(0.01) 
BT Scatter 
For BT scatter, volume on BT beam, the scatter transmission loss L(0.01) is calculated from equation 4.6 given in section 4.4.2 with: 
B = 3 dB D = maximum rain cell diameter and rs, Gs pertaining to the earth station 
BE Scatter 
For BE scatter, volume on BE beam, the scatter transmission loss L(0.01) is calculated from equation 4.6 given in section 4.6.2 with: 
B = OdB D = maximum rain cell diameter 
and rs, Gs pertaining to the terrestrial station.

STEPS 
Calculate the ES Beam-Axis Vector BE 
First calculate the S, E, Z components ofthe topocentric coordinates system of the Es. Following section 4.8.4 we have: 
Z1 = 0.354823963 Z2 = 0.54776948 

Z3 = 0.7576599164 where: Z = [Z1, Z2, Z3] and from equation 4.31 we have: = -0.5477694828
E1 
= 0.354823963
E2 
= 0
E3 where: E = [E1, E2, E3] and the magnitude ofE is: [El = .ET + E~ + E~ = 0.6526495622 therefore the unit vector Eu will be: 
) 
-E 
EuJ = I El I = -0.8393010806 Eu2 = E2 = 0.543668981
[El = E3
Eu3 = 0
[El 
where: Eu [Eu!, Eu2, Eu3 J 
From the calculated components Eu and Z calculate the S component using equation 4.34 (see section 4.8.4) that is: 

from where we obtain: 

Sul = Eu2 Z3 -Eu3 Z2 = 0.4119146166 
0 
Su2 = Eu3 Z1 -Eu1 Z3 = 0.6359047866 Su3 = Eu1 Z2 -Eu2 Z1 = -0.6526495622 and: Su = [Sui, Su2, Su3 l 
Next, from the geodetic latitude, calculate the geocentric latitude CLAT, and the distance from the earth's center to the ES. 
From equation 4.26 (see section 4.7.2) we have: Tan (CLAT) = (1 -t)2 Tan (LAT) or 
Tan (CLAT) = Arc Tan (1.153126845) = 49.06793267° or 
CLAT = 49° 4' 4.5" 
From equation 4.27 (see section 4.7.2) we obtain: 
JREI = -===IRE====I== 
0 
1+ e2 sin2 (CLAT)
2
1-e 
where: IREI = 6374.815 km 

0.0067396608 
therefore: IREI = 6362.589159 km Following section 4.8.5, from the calculated CLAT and distance generate the unit geocentric vector IRul. That is: 
REu1 = -cos (CLAT) • cos (LONG) = 0.3561908424 REu2 = cos (CLAT) sin (LONG) = 0.5498796414 
0 

REu3 = sin (CLAT) = 0.7554869051 
where: 

and: IREul = 1 (unit vector) 
From the calculated, unit vector Ru and the distance I RI calculate the geocentric vector, RE, 
where REI = REu1 • R = 2266.295992 km RE2 = REu2 • R = 3498.658245 km RE3 = REu3 • R = 4806.852792 km 
and: RE= [REi,RE2,RE3] 
The calculated geocentric vector RE is from the earth's center to the ES, assuming zero ground elevation, now calculable to the vector IiiHIfrom the earth's center to the ES antenna center. ) The ES antenna center height is given by: IHI = Ground elevation+ 6 m = 61 + 6 = 67 IIi Therefore 
REHi -IHI• z, + RE1 = 2266.319766 RE H2 -IHI• Z2 + RE2 = 3498.694945 REH3 -IHl•Z3 + RE3 = 4806.90355 
where: REH = [REH!, REH2, REH3] and: IREH I = 6362.656159 
Next, following section 4.8.7, generate the geostationary satellite vector S. From the equation

Su2 = 0.94565185756 ' su3 = 0 
where:

and from equation 4.40 we obtain: 
S1 = IS I • Sul = 13719.28371. S2 = IS I • Su2 = 39843.69297 S3 = ISi • Su3 = 0 
where: S = [S1,S2,S3] and Is I = 42,139.5137 km 
Utilizing equation 4.41 (see section 4.9.2) we generate the earth stations beam axis vector BE, given by: 
BE= S -RH 
that is: BE1 = S1 -RH! = 11452.96394 BE2 = S2 -RH2 = 36344.99803 BE3 = S3 -R H3 = 4806.90355 
where:

BE= [BE1,BE2,BE3] 
and: I BE I = 38408.79569 km 
Following section 4.9.3 calculate the ES elevation angle ELES. From equation 4.46 we have 

BE1Z1 + BE2Z2 + BE3Z3 
cos (BE,Z) = IBEl•IZI or 4063.786053 + 19908.68077 -3641.99814 cos (BE, Z) = 20330.46868 
and 0 = Arc cos (BE,Z) = 58.04061049° 
therefore from equation 4.9.2 we obtairi 
ELES = 31.95938951 ° 
) 
Next, following section 4.9.4. calculate the ES Azimuth AZES. Using equation 4.49 we have cos 0 = o.950283763 or 0° = ARc cos 0° = 18.14273153° And from equation 4.50 AZES = 161.8572685° 
STEP6 Calculate the TS beam Axis Vector BT 
From the given geographical parameters of the terrestrial station TS and the adjacent terrestrial station UTS, following section 4.10.2 we obtain

where: 
BT= [BT1,BT2,BT3] 
STEP7 
Following section 4.9.5 calculate the ES . TS effective vector ETRV. 
From the calculated vectors REH and RTH we calculate the difference in height between ES and TS, equation 4.53, (section 4.9.5). 
[HI = IRTHI-IREHI = 0.035581377 and from equation 4.52 (section 4.9.5) we obtain 
~o = 0.0021365285 
0 

From the angular distance $, and the height H, calculate the apparent elevation angle 0° (see section 4.9.5). The angle 0° is the apparent elevation angle between ES . TS that is 
(ELESTS) = 0° = 0.1047009456° 
and: 
ETRV1 = RTHJ -REHi = 10.16640461 ETRV2 = RTH2 -REH2 = -8.865632317 ETRV3 = RTH3 -REH3 = 1.682624244 
and: jETRVI = 13.59361775 km 
therefore, the unit vector of ERTV will be:

ERTVu2 = -0.6521907913 
ERTVu3 = 0.123780459 
STEPS 
Calculate the ES Off-Axis angle ESOX. Using equation 4.5 of section 4.9.6 we obtain 
(ESOX) = Angle (BE,ETRV) = 144.1805° 
STEP9 
Calculate the effective of Rx gain ofthe ES antenna. From the ES· antenna pattern, find the discrimination in dB, which corresponds to the off-axis angle (ESOX). 
For ESOX = 114.1805° . ES Discrim. = 69 dB. The ES Antenna gain ESGRX = 50.9 dBi 
Engineering Considerations 4-97 Fall 1996 

therefore: 
ES GRX (114.1805)0 = 50.9 -69 = -18.l dBi 
STEP 10

Calculate the TS-ES effective vector TERV. AS in STEP 7, the elevation angle (ELTSES) = -0.15919589° and: [TERVu1[ = -0.7624199768 [TERVu2[ = 0.6279860448 [TERVu3[ = -0.1560426431 where: [TERv[ = 13.602537 km 
STEP 11 
Calculate the TS Off-Axis angle (TSOX) 
TSOX = Angle (BT, TERV) or (TSOX) = -0.7° 

STEP 12 
Calculate the effective Tx gain of the TS antenna. For the TS antenna pattern, find the discrimination in dB which corresponds to the calculated off axis angle (TSOX). 
For TSOX = -0.7° . TS Discr. = 2 dB 
The TS Antenna gain TSGTX = 39.4 dBi 
therefore: 
TS GTX (0.7°) = 37.4 dBi 
STEP 13 
Calculate, Mode A, 20% basic transmission loss L(20%). Since the distance ES-TS is 13.6 km 
) 
i.e. 13.6 km< 90 km from equation 4.2 (section 4.3.2). L(20%) = 104.45 + 20 log D + 20 log f/4 or 
where for D = 13.6 km and F =3920 MHz 
we obtain: 
L(20%) = 126.9453 dB 
STEP 14 
Calculate, Mode A, 20% interference level 1(20) 
1(20%) = TSP TX+ TS GTX(0.7°) -L(20%) + ES GRX(l 14.18°) or: 1(20%) = -101.1 dBW 
And for ES receive power of-120 dBW we obtain: 
C/I (20) = -120 + 101.1 = -18.9 dB 

STEP 15 
Calculate, Mode A, 0.01 % basic transmission loss. From equation 4.4 (section 4.3.5) and for D = 16.3 km< 90 km we have 
L(0.01) = 126.9453 dB 
STEP 16 
Calculate, Mode A, 0.01 % interference level I(0.01) 
I(0.01) = -101.1 dBW and: C/I(0.01) = -18.9dB 
STEP 17 
From the C/I curves, compare C/I calculate with (C/I) required. 
For a frequency separation, between ES-TS links of 10 MHz the required C/I for 20% is 32.5 dB C/I for 0.01 % is 16.53 dB therefore: 
Calculated C/I (20) -Required C/I (20) = -18.9 -32.5 = -51.4 dB 
Calculated C/I (0.01) -Required C/I (0.01) = -18.9 -16.53 = -35.1 dB. The results of STEP 16 indicate that interference exists in the MODE A proprogation. 
STEP 18 Prepare path profile between ES-TS. 
Assuming that the path profile does not provide the required blockage of 51.4 dB. The proposed ES channel must be changed such that the frequency separation will eliminate interference or relocate the proposed ES. 
Ifthe new ES frequency plan eliminates interference for Mode A, 20% and 0.01 %, then proceed with the calculation ofMode B interference as given in section 4.12 Precipitation Scatter. 
If the results ofthe above calculations indicate no interference from TS when ES is receiving, then repeat the above calculations to determine interference level when ES is transmitting and TS is receiving.

ANNEX4.12A DERIVATION OF THE RAIN SCATTER LOSS ALGORITHM 
A. MINIMUM DISCRIMINATION ALGORITHM 
4.12A.1 General 
The rain scatter loss calculation algorithm will consider two cases: the rain scatter cell is on the vector joining the earth station and the satellite, or is on the vector joining the two terrestrial stations. 
The same rain scatter equations, rain zones and maximum rain cell heights, using in other MICS programs are also used in this algorithm. 
In the analysis that follows vectors are given in terms ofdistance, azimuth and elevation (these can be obtained by using programs INVPOS and SATAZE). 
) 
4.12A.2 Rain Scatter Cell on the ES Vector 
In the figure: E is the earth station S is the direction to the satellite T is the terrestrial station under analysis U is the remote terrestrial station linked to T V 
is the rain scatter volume ( or cell), centered on the ES vector in this case a= <t UTV is the discrimination angle of the terrestrial antenna at T. 
ES is the unit vector from the earth station in the direction to the satellite ET is the vector from the earth station to the terrestrial station. TU is the vector from the terrestrial station T to the terrestrial station U. 
Engineering Consideration 4.12A-1 Fall 1996 

EV is the vector from the earth station to the rain scatter volume. 
TV is the vector from the terrestrial station T to the rain scatter volume. Therefore: 
ET+TV=11,ES 
TV =11, ES-ET 
Where 11, is a positive scalar number. The distance from the earth station tot he rain scatter volume is numerically equal to "'· The parameter 11, is calculated by making minimum the discrimination angle a. Three cases could occur for a minimum. 
The calculated "' is less than 0.1 or negative. In this case 11, will be arbitrarily set at 0.1 (since distances are in km, this would mean that the rain scatter volume is at a minimum of 100 meters in front ofthe ES (earth station) antenna); 
"' is positive, but the calculated rain cell height is greater than the maximum height. In this case "' will be recalculated using the maximum rain cell height corresponding to the latitude ofthe ES; 
the calculated value of"' is greater than 0.1 and less or equal to the value corresponding to the maximum rain cell height. In this case the calculated value of"' will be used. 
The discrimination angle a can be calculated as follows: 
TU.TV 
cos a = 
ITul ITvl 
"'ES. TU-ET. TU 
= 
ITullTvl 
"' ES • TU -ET• TU 
= (11,2 + ET2 -211,ES • ET)112 
The condition for a minimum is obtained by differentiating with respect to "-, equating to zero and solving for 11,: 
ET2 (ES • TU) -(ET. TU) (ES • ET) 
/1., = "' "' 
(ES • ET) (ES • TU) -(ET. TU) substituting this value of A., the vectors EV and TV, and the discrimination angle a., can be 
calculated. 
The condition for A. minimum also determines a rain cell height. If this rain cell height exceeds 
the maximum rain cell height corresponding to the latitude of the earth stations, A. and a. have to be recalculated. 
The rain cell height is given by: 
H = [Ev[ sin (ES ELEV) 
where H is the rain cell height, in km, and ES ELEV is the elevation angle ofthe ES vector. If 
this calculated value ofH is greater than the maximum value ofH, HR, then H is set equal to HR. In this case A. has to be re-calculated: 
A-= HR I sin (ESELEV) 
and the angle a. is also re-calculated by substituting this new value of A.. 
) 
The value ofHR is a function of the latitude ofthe earth station, as follows: 
HR= 5.2(km) for lat~ 20° . HR= -0.081 *lat -2450/(lat3) + 7.15(km) for 20° <lat~ 70° HR= 1.47(km) forlat > 70° 
where at is the latitude ofthe earth station. 
4,l4A.3 Rain Scatter Cell on the TU Vector 
In this case: 
TE+EV=vTU 
where v is a positive scalar and 
p<t SEV is the discrimination angle at the ES antenna. 
Engineering Consideration 4.12A-3 Fall 1996 

Following the same procedure as in #2 above, the parameter v is given by: 
TE 2 (TU , ES) -(TE , ES) (TU , TE)
V = """-_,.. (TU , ES) (TU , TE) -(TE , ES) and the discrimination angle ~: A -V (ES. TU) -.(TE. ES)
COSp -_ _ 
[v 2TU2 +TE2 -2v (TU, TE)]l/2 The rain height is given in this case by: 
H = Irv! sin (TUELEV) (km) where TUELEV is the elevation angle of the TU vector. IfH>HR, then His set equal to HR and v recalculated as: 
v=HR/sin (TUELEV) The angle ~ is then recalculated by substituting this new value ofv.

3.B.1 PASSIVE REPEATER LINKS 
0 
There are situation where a direct microwave radio path cannot be established between two points, either because geographical or man-made obstructions. In some of these situations it is possible to establish a path by using a passive repeater ( or repeaters). A passive repeater is a "microwave beam redirector", which will pass the microwave beam around or above the obstacle that would obstruct the direct path. 
A microwave passive repeater link will consist then of two "active" sites (in general there will be two transmit/receive sites which would be joined directly, were not for the obstructions) and one or more passive repeater sites. A condition that must be met in passive repeater links, is that line-of-sight shall exist between active and passive sites and between passive sites, in case that more than one passive is used in the link. 
3.B.2 PASSIVE REPEATER TYPES 
There are two types ofpassive repeaters in common use, at least only these two types are used by FCSA member companies. One consists of two parabolic antennas connected back-to-back through a short piece of waveguide. This type of passive repeater is relatively inefficient and, 
Q because of this, is seldom used. The other, and more commonly used type, is the flat "billboard" type metal reflector, which acts as a microwave radio mirror. 
Bill board passives can be single or doubles. If the passive site can be located off to one side or behind one of the active sites, so that the included angle between the two active sites and the passive site is less then about 130 degrees, a single billboard passive can be used. If the only available location for the passive, however, happens to be more or less in line with the path, a double passive may be needed. A double passive consists of two passive reflectors installed fairly close together, and geometrically arranged so that they reflect the microwave radio beam at the proper angles. 
A microwave radio path can include more than one single or double billboard type passive repeater, but would practically never include more than one back-to-back antenna repeater (because of the low efficiency of this latter one).

3.B.3 PASSIVE REPEATER INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS MODEL 
3.B.3.0 Description of the Model 
The model used within FCSA to perform interference analysis, assumes that there is a "virtual active repeater" at the passive site. The equipment type, and other required parameters, are "transferred" form the corresponding active sites, as explained in paragraphs 3.B.3.1 and 3.B.3.2 below. 
This model can be used either for back-to-back antennas or billboard type passive repeaters. 
3.B.3.1 Back-to-Back Antennas Repeater-Interference Analysis Model 
A link composed of active sites "A" and "B", and passive site "P" is shown in Figure 3.B.3.lA. Its corresponding interference analysis model is shown in Figure 3.B.3.lB.

Virtual Active Repeater 
Figure 3.B.3.1.B Interference Analysis Model of Back-to-Back Antennas Passive Repeater 
The virtual active site (Figure 3.B.3.1.B) equipment and traffic type at side P1 of the passive, is assumed to be identical tot he equipment and traffic type at active B, and the equipment and traffic type at P 2 are assumed to be identical to the equipment and traffic type at active A. 
The receive power at the virtual receivers are calculated the same as for active links. The 
Q receiver power at P1 , for example, is calculated assuming that there is a link b.etween active A transmitter and P1 virtual receiver. Now the transmit power at the virtual transmitter at P2, is numerically equal to the receive power at P1 , since no losses are assumed between the two sides ofthe passive. Finally, the receiver power at active B is calculated assuming that there is a link between the virtual transmitter at P2 and the receiver at active B. 
An interfering signal incident onto the passive repeater, will not affect the passive per se. But it could be re-transmitted to one of the active receivers and cause interference to this receiver. Interference into antenna Pi, for example, could affect the receiver at active B. To predict the interfering effects at an active receiver there are two solutions: calculate the actual interference level (as explained above) and compare with the requirements of the particular active receiver, or to "transfer" the active receiver requirements to the corresponding virtual receiver. Considering program complexity and database structure, FCSA adopted the latter solution. 
In the case of C/I calculations, this approach is very close to the actual case. For example, interference into P 1 would be re-transmitted by the transmitter at P2• But so would be the desired receive signal at P1• Then, the relative level of both signals will be the same at the receiver at active B as at virtual reciever at Pi, with the exception of minor path propagation loss differences if both signals not have exactly the same nominal frequency. 
Fall 1996 3B.1-4 Engineering Considerations 

In the case ofabsolute level ofinterference (-I) calculations, there could be larger difference. For example, if the receive signal level at active B is transferred to the virtual receiver at P1, the following corrections should be applied: 
C.F. = GP2 -PL (2, B) + GB -AFSLB 
where: 
C.F. = correction factor, dB · GP2 = antenna gain at P2, dBi PL(2,B) = propagation loss between P2 and B, dB GB = receive antenna gain at active B, dBi AFSLB = receive antenna feeder system loss at B, dB 

An example ofthis correction factor calculation is presented on Table 3B.1 below. This example shows that, in all practical cases, the error made by "transferring" th~ requirement to the virtual receiver is always in the conservative side. Worst-case, or near-worst-case, values have been used in this example, i.e. largest antenna diameter commercially available for the specific bands and 0.5 km path length. 
Band (GHz)  Ant. Diameter (feet)  Total Ant. Gain (dB)  P. Loss (dB)  Corr. Factor (dB)  
2 4 6 11 18 23  15 15 15 12 6 6  75.6 86.4 93.0 99.8 97.0 100.8  92.45 98.47 101.99 107.26 111.54 113.58  -16.85 -12.07 -8.99 -7.46 -14.54 -12.78  

Table3.B.1 Example of Back-to-Back Passive repeater -I requirement correction Factor 
Engineering Consideration 3B.1-5 Fall 1996 

Let us assume, for example, that a 6 GHz receiver at active B can tolerate a maximum o· 
interference level of -100 (dBm). Then, we translate this requirement without correction to the virtual receiver at P1• Now we will assume that the virtual receiver at P1 can tolerate a maximum interference level of -100 ( dBm), and the program will report an interference case if this level is exceeded. Table 3.B.1 indicates that for 6 (GHz) the correction factor is -8.99 (dB), which really means that the maximum acceptable interference level at P1 should be [-100 -(-8.99)] = -91.1 (dBm). 
(This is equivalent to say that the interfering signal at P2 will have a net propagation loss of 8.99 (dB) from P2 to B. Therefore, a -100 (dBm) signal at P2 will become a -108.99(dBm) signal at 
B). 
The FCSA program does not apply this level-correction factor. Therefore, the interference requirements applied at back-to-back passive repeater sites are always in the conservative side. 
3.B.3.2Billboard Type Passive Repeater Interference Analysis Model 
A microwave radio link including a billboard type passive repeater and its interference analysis model are shown in Figures 3.B.3.2A and 3.B.3.2B respectively.

) 
The interference analysis model is the same as in the case of back-to-back antennas, with the exception of the antennas at the passive repeater site. In this case these are virtual antennas (at P1 and P2). The gain of each one of them is equal to one half of the passive reflector gain, and the main beam coincides with the passive incident/reflected rays. The antenna pattern is assumed to be the same as the passive reflector pattern. 
In this model, like in the previous one, equipment types and characteristics are "transferred" from the active to the virtual site. Thus, equipment at active B will be transferred to the P1 side of the virtual site and active to the P2 side. 
Since the interference requirements are transferred to the virtual site without correction, errors are introduced into the analysis. For the C/I case the error is very minor, due only to the differences in path propagation loss for desired and interference frequencies (in case they are not equal). The error, for the absolute level of interfere (-I) case is estimated in table 3.B.2.

Example of Billboard Passive Reflector -I Requirement Correction Factor 
In Table 3.B.2: 
Pass. Max. G. = is the maximum gain ofthe passive assuming 0 degrees included angle; GTotal = is equal to the antenna gain plus one half ofthe passive gain; dmin = is the minimum far field distance; 
P. Loss = Is the path loss corresponding to the frequency and dmin; 
Corr. F. = Is the -I correction factor, equal to the difference between the total gain and the path loss. 
Table 3B.2 indicates that in this case, like in the back-to-back antennas model, the -I requirement applied at the virtual site is always in the conservative side. For example, for 6.725 (GHz), a 30*32 passive and 15 foot antenna, the requirement applied at the virtual site would be 20 (dB) more stringent then it should be (for a path length equal to the minimum far field distance). 
3.B.4. BILLBOARD TYPE PASSIVE REPEATER FAR-FIELD GAIN 
The far-field billboard type passive repeater gain, is calculated as: 
PGAIN =20 log (EFAREA) + 40 log (Freq.) -77.32344 
where: 
PGAIN = total (two-way) passive repeater gain, dBi 
EFAREA = passive effective area, in m2• Is the passive height times width times the cosine ofhalf the included angle. · 
Freq. = is the frequency in MHz. 

l} 3.B.5. BILLBOARD TYPE PASSIVE REPEATER OFF-AXIS DISCRIMINATION 
The passive off-axis discrimination is calculated as: DISC= 20 log (EFFWID) + 20 log (Freq.)+ 20 log (sin (OA)) -39.5995 
where: DISC = off-axis passive reflector discrimination, (dB) EFFWID = passive effective width; passive width times the cosine ofhalf the included 
angle, (m) Freq. = frequency, (MHz) OA = off-axis angle, from the incident/reflected ray direction, (degrees) 
Note that the passive reflector maximum discrimination is limited to one half of the passive gain. The passive beamwidth, i.e. 3 dB points, is calculated as: ) ABW = sin-1 [134.88734/(EFFWID*Freq)] Where ABW is half of the passive beamwidth, (degrees). Note that ABW is limited to 57.295779 degrees. 
3.B.6 BILLBOARD TYPE PASSIVE REPEATER INCLUDED ANGLE 
The effective area, and therefore the gain, of a billboard type passive reflector is a function ofthe included angle. The included angle is a function of the coordinates of the two active sites and of the passive repeater site. If the elevation angles from the active sites to the passive repeater site are not large, i.e. less then 20 degrees, the horizontal included angle can be used instead of the exact included angle. But, if the elevation angle for any of the active sites to the passive site is greater then 20 degrees, then the exact included angle has to be calculated. The included angle is calculated as follows: 
sine1 + sine2
cos(IA / 2) = 
2 sin e 3 

where: 
IA = is the (total) included angle, (degrees) El = least vertical path (active-to-passive) angle, (degrees) s2 = greatest vertical path angle, (degrees) s3 = vertical face angle ofthe passive, (degrees) 
The passive vertical face angle can be calculated form the following relations: 
tana(cos EJ -cos s2)
tan l:i.a =__:..__ _,____-""­
( ) cos llj + COS ll2 
cos(l:i.a)(sine1-sine2) 
tan(e3 ) = cosa (cos llJ + cos e2) 
Where a is the horizontal included angle, (degrees). 
In these formulas al the cosines are positive and the sines are considered positive when the angle froni. the passive in below the horizontal and negative when above. 
0 
3.B.7 BILLBOARD TYPE PASSIVE REPEATER NEAR-FIELD CONSIDERATIONS 
There are situation where the passive reflector is in the near-field of one of the active-sites antenn!ls, In this case the gain of the passive reflector and the gain of the antenna are no longer independent. They interact one with each other in such a way that the overall net gain is reduced. This reduction in the overall gain is important in path design, to calculate the receiver signal level at the other active site (i.e. the active site in the far-field). The FCSA interference analysis model however, does to take into consideration this net gain reduction. The model, which is the same discussed in 3.B.3 above, assumes full gain at the active site and near-field passive. This assumption will produce results which are in the conservative side.

DEFINITION OF EIRPADV AND DISTADV. 
For a terrestrial station X, receiving the wanted signal C from TS Y and the interfering signal I from TS A, we have that: 
C/I (dB) = C (dB) -I (dB) 3A-1 
where: 
C = EIRP (Y) + GRX (X) -AFSL (X) -Path Loss (XY) =_ = EIRP (Y) + GRX (X) -AFSL (X) -32.45 -20 log (XY) -20 log (Freq.) 3A-2 and: I = EIRP (A) + GRX (X) -ANT. DISCR. -AFSL (X) -Path loss (AX) = = EIRP (A) + GRX (X) -ANT. DISCR. -AFSL (X) -32.45 -20 log (XA) -20 LOG (Freq.) 3A-3

In Chapter 3 the technical parameters applicable only to terrestrial stations are described in detail. The propagation models required for interference calculations are defined followed by a description of the required interference anlaysis. Examples are given to illustrate the interference calculation procedure.

Long haul system -based on a hypothetical reference circuit where the sum of the tandem path lengths is 5000 km 

b) 
Short haul system -based on a hypothetical reference circuit where the sum of the tandem path lengths does not exceed 400 km 


3.2.2 Noise Allowances 
Long haul system -The per exposure interference allowance for long haul analog system is 4 dBmCO. For digital systems is 1 ( dB) degradation of the receiver thermal noise threshold. 
Short haul system -The short haul interference requirments state that an interference signal will not degrade the overall system noise objective by more than 1 dB under fully faded conditions. For short-haul digital systems operating above 18(GHz), the allowable digradation is 3(dB) of the reciever fade margin. 
3.2.3 Terrestrial Station Antenna Characteristics 
In addition to the antenna parameters defined in Chapter 2, Terrestrial Station to Terrestrial Station (TS-TS) interference calculations must include antennae polarization discrimination. 
Copolar Signals 
Total antenna discrimination is the sum of the copolar discrimination of the interfering transmit antenna and that ofthe desired receiving antenna .. 

:J Crosspolar Signals 
Total antenna discrimination is the smaller ofeither the sum of: 
1. 
The copolar discrimination of the interfering antenna and the crosspolar discrimination of the desired antenna. 

2. 
The crosspolar discrimination of the interfering antenna and the copolar discrimination of the desired antenna. 


Therefore for a desired antenna D and an interfering antenna I, the worst case combination of 
polarization discrimination is determined as follows: 
Desired Interfering Antenna Antenna D I

3.2.6 Power Levels 
0 
PTMAX is the maximum transmit power in a given microwave link in dBm. 
PTMIN is the minimum transmit power in a given microwave link in dBm. 
PRMIN is the minimum recieved power at the antenna input, that is, if a terrestrial station A recieves from a terrestrial station B, then: 
PRMIN (A) = PTX MIN (B) + AGAIN (B) -AFSL (B) 3.1 -Free space loss between A and B. 
The above parameters are utilized in the calculations of interference in Band (B) analysis or in the early system design stages when little is known about the interference environment of what frequency plan should be selected. The calculations for the available carrier C and interference I levels are: 
C = PRIMIN (victim) + AGAIN (victim) -AFSL (victim) 3.2 
I = PTMAX (interferer) -AFSL (interferer) 3.3 
+ 
AGAIN (interferer) -32.45 -20 log (vicitrn to interferor distance) -20 log (midband frequency) -(total antenna discrimination) 

+ 
AGAIN (victim) -AFSL (victim) 


In the above equations, powers are in dBm, gains are in dBi, distance is in km, and frequency is in MHz. 
Canadian Telecommunications Carriers, in Band analysis, utilize default powers PTMAX and PRMIN, if either or both of these are absent. The default values are: 
PTMAX = 40 dBm PRMIN = -80 dBm 
For passive repeaters AFSL transmit and receive are taken to be zero in the computation of the interference I level caused by the passive repeater. 
For chaimel (C) analysis the available carrier and interference levels are calculated utilizing the actual parameters provided in the information files ofthe terrestrial stations. 

Distance Advantage 
Distance advantage (DADV) is given by the equation interference path length 
Distance advantage = 20 log 3.4

EIRP Advantage (EIRPADV)

EIRP advantage (EIRPADV) is defined by the equation: EIRPADV = EIRP ofthe transmitting station in the desired link, i.e. the station from which the victim station receives the desired signal EIRP of the interfering station 3.5 From equaitons 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 we obtain: C/I = EIRP ADV + DIST ADV + Total antenna discrimination 3.6 
For detailed calculations see Annex 3A. 
3.2.7 Antenna Feed System Loss 
From antenna with radome, if the radome does not affect the antenna pattern, the radome loss must be added to the Antenna Feed System Loss (AFSL). Otherwise a new antenna pattern must be produced. 
3.2.8 Equipment Characteristics 
.The frequency stabilities for some equipment commonly used by FCSA members are: 
_) 

{± 0,005% (± 194KHz) 0
4 GHz=> 
± 0.0025 (± 78 KHz) 
± 0.002% (± 124 KHz) ± 0.005% (± 309 KHz) 
6GHz => ± 0.004% (± 247 KHz) ± 0.002 (± 1.235 MHz) 
11 GHz=> ± 0.005% (± 5.6 MHz) 
The above stability values are the net values including the cumulative effect of the· initial modulator if any, and intervening transmit local oscillators and receive local oscillators or frequency shifters. In the case of remodulating equipment this degenerates to the transmit oscillator stability alone. 
In cases where the net stability is not known, or the above values seem conservative, the stability should be computed in the following way. 
Remodulating Equipment 
Use the stability ofthe transmit oscillator that is likely to be obtained for 95% of the time, taking into account factors such as the maintenance regime and temperature environment to be expected. 
Heterodyne Equipment Involving Repeater Frequency Shifters 
Determine the longest modulations section (in terms of number of hops) that is likely to exist in normal service using this equipment. If: 

number of hops. stability of modulator, referred to RF (not to 70 MHz). stability of first transmit local oscilator. stability of each shifter (not the repeater local oscilator). 

Then the total stability ofthe signal transmitted on the H'th hop is: 
,J 2 2 2
SH =SM + STLO + (H -1) SsH 
The above stability values should be the values that are likely to obtain 95% of the time, considering the expected maintenance regime and temperature environment to be expected.

If: 
H = number of hops SM = stability of modulator, referred to RF SrLO = stability of each transmit local oscilator 
= stability of each receive local oscilator

Then: 2
SH= .SM 2 + H SrLO + (H-1) sho 
) The above stability values should be the values that are likely to obtain 95% of the time, considering the expected maintenance regime and temperature environment to be expected. 
3.2.9 Filtering 
The filter characteristics ofthe receive and transmit equipment are required for the calculation of the interference level I or the carrier to noise ratio C/1 (see Annex 2A.2). 
If the filter characteristics are not known, FCSA members, for the calculation of interference level, assume a filter with a 25 dB per octave roll-off and cut-off at: 
Fe = ± 1.5 (f + 2f8) 3.7 
Where:

3.3 PROPAGATION MODELS

3.3.1 Free Space Propagation Loss 
For the calculation of the interference level Free Space, propagation is assumed, as default, on the desired and interfering paths. The free space path loss in dB is given by the equation: 
Loss ( dB) = Constant+ 20 log (Dist)+ 20 log (Freq) 
where: 
Dist = path distance in km or miles Freq = operating frequency in MHz 
--132.45 if Dist is in km Constant 
36.6 if Dist is in miles 
Post-analysis is necessary to add the effects of obstructions on paths. Usually, inspection of a 
0 
topographical map along the path between the interfering TS and the victim TS, as well knowledge of the distance separating them (which brings the earth's curvature into the calculation), will reveal whether or not any path blockage, and hence, any extra attenuation ofthe interfering signal, may be expected. Clearly, if it is obvious that none can be expected, it is futile to draw the profile. 
Ifpath blockage is likely, then the path profile is drawn, using, generally k = 4/3 graph paper. It is very important, when drawing path profiles, to use the appropriate antenna height above ground level and not the tower height since terrestrial station towers support many antennas at different heights. Use of the tower height is a worst-case and is only justifiable when the antenna height is not known. 
Once the path profile is drawn, it is obvious whether or not path blockage exists. If path blockage exists the extra loss, above free space loss, must be calculated. The additional attenuation provided by the blockage(s) can then be added to the C/I ratio or subtracted from the interference level I. 
3.3.2 CCIR-SJM Propagation Loss Model 
This propagation loss calculation model has been in use within FCSA since its creation. It is 
described in section 4.3.3 of this manual. 
3.3.3 CCIR Spherical Earth Propagation Loss Calculation Model 
This propagation loss calculation method is based on CCIR Report 238-6. 
The algorithm used within FCSA for calculating the Spherical Earth propagation loss is 
described in the following paragraphs. 
3.3.3.1 Antenna Heights 
) The antenna heights used in this algorithm are as follows: 
HTx = aht (int, agl) + intgrnd (ams!) is the antenna height, in meters, ofthe interfering transmit station; 
HRx = aht (vie, agl) + vicgmd (ams!) is the antenna height, in meters ofthe victim receiving station. 
3.3.3.2 Transition Distance 
The transition distance, Dh in km, is defined as follows: Dh = 4:123* ((HTx"0.5) + (HRx"0.5)) It is the added distance to the common horizon of the interfering and victim stations. 
3.3.3.3 Spherical Earth Propagation Loss Calculation 
a) For d>Dh the Spherical Earth propagation loss is calculated as follows: 
Ploss = 29.73+30*log(Fmhz)+ 10log(d)+30*log(theta)+N(H,h) 
Where:· 
Ploss = pathloss, in dB Fmhz = Interfering frequency, in MHz d = Interfering to victim site distance, km theta = (d-Dh)/8.5 H = theta*d/4000 h = l.063*(theta"2)*(10"-3) N(H,h) = 20*log(5+0.27*H)+ 1.17261 *h 
b) For d<= Dh the Spherical Earth propagation loss is calculated as free space propagation loss: 
Ploss= 32.45+20*log(d)+20*log(Frequency) 
where: 
d is the path length in km and the frequency is in MHz. 
3.3.4 PCS-HATA Propagation Loss Calculation Model 
This model is to be used only for the PCS versus fixed point-to-point microwave radio interference analysis. 
This model has been implemented within FCSA following the algorithms described in TIA Bulletin 1 0G (Annex F). The algorithms are described in the following paragraphs. 
3.3.4.1 Antenna Heights 
The antenna heights used in this algorithm are as follows: 
-Ifinterfering transmitting station is the PCS station, then interferer ( aht) = Hpcs and victim (aht) = Hmw. 
-Ifthe victim receiving station is the PCS station, then interferer (aht) = Hmw and victim (aht) = Hpcs. 
Note that aht is the antenna height (agl) plus the site altitude (ams!) in meters. 
3.3.4.2 Transition Distance 
The transition distance, Dh in km, id defined as follows: 
Dh = 4.123 *((Hpcs"0.5) + (Hmw"0.5)) 
) This is the added distance to the common horizon. 
3.3.4.3 Propagation Loss Beyond the Horizon 
For d>Dh the following equation will apply:

) BAND ANALYSIS MODE (B) 
STEP 7: Calculation of EIRP Advantage 
Substituting in equations 3.5 the worst case parameters given in Tables 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 we obtain: 
EIRP advantage (A . X) = EIRP (Y)MrN -EIRP (A)MAX 
where: 
EIRP (Y)MrN = PTXMIN (Y) + GTX (Y) -AFSL (Y) = 30 + 29.5 -0.5 = 59.0 dBi 
EIRP(A)MAX = PTXMAX (A) + GTX (A) -AFSL (A) = 40 + 32 -1.9 = 70.1 dBi 
Substituting the values ofEIRP (Y)MrN and EIRP (A)MAX we have that 
EIRPadvantage(A . X) = 59.0 -70.1 = -II.I dB

STEP 10: Calculations of the Carrier to Interference Ratio C/1 in dB

C/I = EIRP advantage+ DIST advantage+ Total antenna discrimination 
Substituting in the above equations the calcualted values of: 
EIRP Advantage in STEP 7 Table 3.5.6 DIST Advantage in STEP 8 Table 3.5.7 ANTENNA Discrimination in STEP 9 Table 3.5.12 
We obtain the C/I values for all the interference cases as a result of Band Analysis. The results are shown in Table 3.5.13.

STEP 11: 
For BAND analysis mode the required C/I value is+110 dB. 
Therefore: 
IF: ( C/I) calculated > 11 0 dB ----" No interference 
IF: . (C/I) calculated < +110 dB ----" Proceed with channel analysis 
In this study case, all the calculated values in Table 3.5.13, are less than +110 dB. Therefore we must proceed with the CHANNEL analysis mode for all the above interference cases of Table 3.5.13. 

CHANNEL ANALYSIS 
In channel analysis we utilize the actual transmit power (PTXMIN), the actual polarization discrimiantion and the required C/I for the given equipment type, traffic type and frequency separation. Therefore, we must recalculate the EIRP advantage using PTXMIN for the wanted link and recalculate the total antenna discriminations. 
STEP 12: EIRP Advantage Calculations for CHANNEL Mode 
Substituting in Equation 3.5 the actual parameters given in Tables 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 we obtain 
EIRP advantage (A.X) = EIRP (Y)MIN a EIRP (A)MIN 
where: 
EIRP (Y)MIN = calcualted in STEP 7 EIRP (A)MIN = PTXMIN (A) + CTX (A) -AFSL (A) = 33 + 32 -1.9 = +63.1 dBi
) 
and: 
EIRP advantage (A.X) = 59 -63.1 = -4.1 dB 
Repeating the same calculations for all the sites A, B and Y we obtain the EIRP advantage of each site for the channel mode analysis. The results are given in Tables 3.5.14 and 3.5.15.

INTRODUCTION 
The intent of this annex is to provide a tractable presentation on the general principles used in computing interference objectives and to serve as a guideline for MICS users. It presents the theory required to develop objectives for interference between Digital into Analog (D/ A), Analog into Digital (AID) and Digital into Digital (DID) cases. This supplements the existing FCSA documentation for Analog into Analog (A/A) cases. It discusses the methods and assumptions used in computing the permissible carrier to interference (C/I) and absolute interference level (I) for specific victim and interferer traffic pairs in accordance with long haul and short haul criteria. 
FCSA has computer programs to carry out the necessary calculations for the above interference cases thus, extending MICS to include interference associated with digital radio equipment. This annex includes: 
1. 
Problem statement. 

2. 
Definition of CTX objective and its relationship to the MICS program. 

3.

5. A discussion on the assumptions and constraints associated with the use of CTX data. 
2.0 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
0 
The use of digital microwave radio systems created a need to develop analytical tools for estimating permissible levels of interference. The original tools were developed before digital radios appeared on the market and thus did not consider them. These tools needed upgrading to perform calculations which include DIA, AID and DID interference cases for various types of radio equipment. To this end AGT, on behalf of FCSA, has developed a set of computer programs dealing with the above interference cases. The intent of this CTX curve development is to extend the MICS database to . include digital radio equipment by exhausting all feasible interference scenarios between equipment types. 
2.1 TS-TS SHORT HAUL INTERFERENCE OBJECTIVE 
FCSA has set, for terrestrial-into-terrestrial M/W radio interference, a maximum permissible interference level for short haul digital and analog applications at the level (measured at the victim receiver's input port) which causes the victim's fade margin to be reduced by 1.0 dB below 18 
Q GHz and 3 dB above 18 GHz. This maximum level will vary with the· separation between the victim's and interferer's carrier frequencies and with different equipment types. In this case, a CTX curve is simply a graph which relates the permissible interference power to frequency separation for specific interferer/victim pairs. 
2.2 TS-TS LONG HAUL INTERFERENCE OBJECTIVE 
The long haul interference ·objective for terrestrial M/W radio digital systems is 1.0 dB degradation to the receiver's noise threshold. For analog systems the objective remains the same as for the A/A case (4.0 dBrnCO worst-slot noise). 
3.0 
SOLUTION OUTLINE 
This section discusses a solution to the above problem for the main co-channel CTX objective. A discussion on spurious response appears in Section 4. 
3.1 DIA CASE 
The interfering effect into a co-channel analog victim will depend on the energy distribution of the interfering signal. The treatment of the DIA case is identical to the A/A case (which was developed earlier) except that in the DIA case empirically derived interference power spectral density (PSD) data (rather than computed PSD data ) is used. The theoretical development of AlA interference is discussed in Annex 2A.1. 
3.2 DID AND AID CASES
) 
This section discusses DID and AID interference cases. Since the treatment of DID is identical to AID, one Interference model is used. Both cases use empirically derived victim frequency response data. The DID case uses empirically derived interferer PSD data while the AID case uses computer generated interferer PSD data. A digital victim is sensitive to the total interference power of the interferer at the demodulator. This sensitivity to interference is well correlated with the Nyquist bandwidth and is related to the thermal noise floor power. The noise floor power is independent of modulation method and data rates, but dependent solely on receiver bandwidth and receiver noise figure. The method adopted by ·FCSA assumes that the total interference power at the demodulator input when added to the thermal noise power represents fairly closely the degradation of threshold, relative to the threshold with thermal noise alone. 

3.2.1 Interference Model Elements 
The interference model is based on the following elements: 
1. 
The interferer is the interference level at the victim receiver's input port. The receiver's input port is defined as the input to the drop circulator of the receiver (see Figure I). Note that the receiver noise figure shall be referenced to this point. Interference energy is expressed in terms of PSD where, for reason of computational simplicity, the PSD center frequency is reference to OHz. 

2. 
The 'Receiver Input Port' and 'Transmitter Output Port' are defined to include the effects of RF filtering and branching circulator per the following sketches. These components may be an integral part of the receiver shelf or may be external. The losses of these components must be considered when defining the transmit power and receiver noise figures. These ports are the reference points for transmit spectrums and receiver selectivity and is the point at which absolute interference is calculated and C/I values are valid. 


CIRCULATOR 

NOTE: The transmitter/receive power must be referenced to the designated Transmit/Receive Output/Input Port. 
Absolute Interference Level, C/I and Noise Figure must be referenced to the designated Receiver Input Port. 
Figure 1. Transmit/Receive Reference Points 
3. The effect of interference into digital receivers is controlled by the combination of RF, IF and BB filtering. The image response if affected by the RF filter only. In examining the signal processing operation of extracting BB from RF it is evident that the victim is essentially a low pass filter. Therefore, the victim sensitivity can be characterized by the combined frequency response of the receiver RF and IF filters and demodulator BB filter (the combined frequency response is referenced to O MHz) arranged in tandem. The victim sensitivity is defined in terms of its (output power)/ (input power) transfer function and is denoted by IH(f)l2, 
Note: Referring the victim's frequency response (center frequency) to the interferer's center frequency, the frequency response of the victim is therefore IH(f -fs)l2, where the relative center frequency difference is fs, 
3.2.2 Interference Model Assumptions 
This section discusses the relationship between the interference power level and the thermal noise ofthe victim at the slicer (i.e., IPc(fs)I). 
In developing this relationship the following assumptions apply: 
) 
1. The interfering signal appearing at the victim's slicer is assumed to be 'white noise like', therefore the victim's noise floor is computed be adding the victim's thermal noise to the 
interfering signal on a power basis. 
2. 
The level of fade margin degradation (dB) is equal to the increase in white noise power level (i.e., thermal noise plus interference) at the victim slicer (dB). A degradation criterion of 1 dB is considered for CTX curves. If changes to the criterion are justified, the CTX curves would be adjusted. 

3. 
Practical receivers are currently designed such that the victim nominal receive power level is 10 dB below the power level of the receiver 1 dB compression point. Refer to Figure 2. 

4. 
The bandwidth (denoted by B) in the thermal noise power calculation (i.e., kTBF) is the 


• brickwall filter bandwidth. A brickwall filter is defined as an ideal filter that has the same area under the curve as the actual combined RF + IF + BB filters used.

3.2.3 Interference Model Concepts 
The interference model is based on the following elements: 
1. 
Fade margin degradation is caused by the appearance of interference noise at the victim's demodulator slicer (i.e., noise at the output of the BB filter). The interference noise appearing at the slicer is the interference energy that is filtered by the receiver RF, IF and demodulator baseband filters (i.e., the filter arrangement discussed in Section 3.2.1 (3)). The interference problem involves computing the interference power level at the victim's slicer for a given interference spectrum and receiver filter (RF + IF + BB) response. 

2. 
It is assumed that fade margin degradation is controlled only by the magnitude of the interfering signal. 


The interference objective problem therefore centers on computing, for any frequency separation, the permissible interference power intensity (at the victim's receiver input port) which will cause the victim's fade margin to degrade by 1 dB. 
Note: This is the interference power appearing at the victim's slicer which is 5.87 dB (this figure will be explained later) below the victim's thermal noise level. Given a victim's filter (combined RF, IF and BB) power transfer function IH(f)l2, interferer's PSD S(f) and 
) frequency separation fs, the interference power level at the victim's demodulator slicer P(fs) can be computed. P(fs) is the area below the curve resulting from the product of the interferer's PSD and the victim's transfer function: 
S(f) IH(f -fs)l2 
Therefore, the interference power level at the slicer is 
P(fs) = fw S(f) IH(f -fs)l2 df. EQl 
The interference objective problem is to compute the magnitude of the interferer PSD (i.e., S(f)) for a given frequency separation (fs) such that the interference power level (i.e., P) at the victim's slicer would cause to 1.0 dB threshold degradation (i.e., victim fade margin reduced by 1.0 dB). Note that in computing CTX curves P(fs) = constant, where this constant is defined in EQ 2 below. 

From section 3.2.2.(a) it follows that: 
Noise Floor= Thermal Noise+ Interference. EQ2 
For computational simplicity the interference power is defined as 'a' times the victim's thermal noise power, where 'a' is a constant relating to the fade margin degradation criterion. The noise power appearing at the slicer is referenced to the victim thermal noise which is 
P(fs) = (a) (kTBF) EQ3 
where: k = 1.38054 x 10-23 joules/degrees Kelvin (Boltzmann's constant), T = 290 degrees Kelvin (ambient temp. ofthe victim), B = The thermal noise bandwidth, 
(i.e., the brickwall filter bandwidth in this model) F = Noise figure cif victim ( expressed as a ratio). 
Therefore, from EQ 2 and EQ 3 it follows that: Elevated Noise Floor= (kTBF) + (a) (kTBF). EQ4 From Section 3 .2.2(b) for a 1.0 dB fade margin degradation it follows that (Note: The 'log' operation implies logarithm to base 10.): Elevated Noise Floor, (Thermal Noise)= Fade Margin Degradation, hence 
10 log {(kTBF) + (a) (kTBF)} , 10 log (kTBF) = 1.0 dB. EQS 
Combining EQ 4 and EQ 5 yields 
10 lo (a)(kTBF) + (kTBF) = 1.0 dB 
EQ6 
g (kTBF) which simplifies to: 
10 log (a+ 1)= 1.0 dB EQ7 
Hence, a= 0.259 (= -5.87 dB). 
Therefore, from EQ 3 the interference power level (P(fs)) appearing at the victim's demodulator 
slicer is: P(fs) = (0.259) (kTBF). EQ8 We assume that the interferer's PSD is not altered by transmission (only it's magnitude) therefore we can write s(f) as: S(f) = I(f) s(f), ). EQ9 where: s(f) is the interferer's normalized transmitter PSD 
(i.e., s(f) = S(f)/ s:S(f) df). 
) I (fs) is the magnitude of the permissible absolute power level at the victim's receiver input port (interference objective) which causes the victim's fade margin to degrade by 1 dB. 
Therefore the main CTX co-channel interference objective (i.e., I(fs)) can be computed from the interferer normalized PSD and the victim symbol rate, noise figure and filter response. 
Substituting EQ 8 and EQ 9 into EQ I yields: 
2
I (fs) 1: s(f) IH(f -fs)l df = (0.259) (kTBF) EQlO 
Hence the interference objective is computed by: 
I (fs) = SEL (fs) (0.259) (kTBF). EQll 
where the victim's selectivity denoted as SEL (fs) is defined by: 
EQ12 
_) Note: Selectivity is a measure ofthe victim's ability to exclude the interferer's signal. 
Applying the 10 log operation to both sides ofEQ 11 yields: 
10 log I(f8) =IO log SEL (fs)+IO log (0.259)+10 log (kTBF) EQ 13 
Therefore, in terms of dBm, the main CTX co-channel interference objective ( denoted by IL VL (fs)) is: 
ILVL (fs) = ESEL (fs) -5.87 + 10 log (kTBF), EQ14 
where: ESEL = 10 log SEL (fs). K is defined specified in terms of milliwatts 
3.2.4 Power Addition of White Noise and Interference 
An important assumption on which our interference model for digital victims depends on, is that interference is assumed to be 'white noise like', thus can be added to the thermal noise of the victim. In using this assumption the computational effort in computing interference objectives is reduced significantly. In this section, we will show by using examples, that this assumption is essentially correct when computing interference objectives for digital victims subject to high BER 
0 
(i.e., 1.E-3 to 1.E-4) and low threshold degradation (i.e., 1 to 3 dB). 
To confirm that interference can be added to victim thermal noise we compare published to estimated Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) data. We have elected to compare SIR data (by observing the correlation between estimated and published data) because published SIR data was provided in graph form for specific Signal to Noise Ratios (SNR) where the Noise (N) is white noise. Estimated SIR data is computed using SNR where the noise is interference plus thermal noise ofthe victim. 
Table 1 shows a comparison between published and computed SIR values. To gain confidence that our interference model supports different types of modulation, we have compared SIR cases involving 16 QAM; 16 PSK and 8 PSK modulation schemes. SIR cases for threshold level to BER = 1.E-3 were examined. The estimated SIR is based on computing Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) by taking the ratio of receive power at receive threshold level (BER = 1.E-3) without interference plus degradation to Noise plus Interference. Published SIR data taken from Prabhu was compared to the SIR values computed using EQ 17. Applying the definition of (SNR) using Figure 3 yields. 

lO(S+D)/10 
SNR = 10 log N/IO 1/IO EQ15 
10 + 10 
where: SNR = Signal to Noise Ratio (dB). S = Receive RF power threshold (dBm) to BER= 1.E-3 without interference. N = Thermal Noise power level ofthe victim receiver (dBm). I = Interference power level (dBm). D = Degradation ofthreshold (dB). 
Solving for N using the definition ofSNR = S-N and substituting the resulting expression into EQ 15 yields: 
SNR/10 lO(S+D)/IO
10 =-~~~~~~ EQ 16
l o(S-SNR)/10 + l oIII0 
Solving for 1oI/l O in EQ 16 and substituting the resulting expression into the definition of SIR= S -I yields: 
) 
lOSNR/10 
SIR= 10 log D/IO EQ17 (10 -1) 
Note that SIR is independent of S and I. Table 1 shows a comparison between SIR computed using EQ 17 and Prabhu's published SIR data (see Figures 5, 6 and 7).

) 
In examining Table 1 it is evident that the discrepancy between estimated and published SIR data is at worst less that 5% in dB. This suggests that there is a strong correlation between estimated and Prabhu' s SIR data. Therefore, we conclude that adding interference power to noise power is reasonable for high BER (i.e., 1.E-4) and low level threshold degradation (i.e., 1 to 3 dB degradation), thus adding interference to white noise is acceptable in carrying out interference objective calculations for digital victims.

4.0 SPURIOUS RECEIVER RESPONSE 
The responses of concern are the image, IF and 1/2 IF response. These all are sensitive to receiver filter characteristics. IF and 1/2 IF response are also sensitive to the receiver signal handling characteristics. 
4.1 IMAGE RESPONSE 
The image response is a mixing phenomenon where the receiver's response to the frequency fRF +/-2fIF (where fRF denotes the victim receiver RF frequency and fIF denotes the victim's intermediate frequency: usually 70 MHz) is limited by the RF filter selectivity at that frequency. The simplest method to generate CTX objectives for image response is to replicate the main co­channel CTX objective shifted by 2fIF and increasing the interference power by the RF filter selectivity at 2fIF MHz from center. This approximation permits some errors due to not accounting for the amplitude slope of the RF filter across the image spectrum; however, CTX objectives are conservative. 
In the CTX model the image response is accounted for by replicating a doublesided version of the
) main CTX objective shifted in frequency by 2fIF and by increasing the interference objective by an amount equal to the RF filter response (attenuation) at frequency fRF +/-2fIF, A comparison is then made between the main interference objective and the replicated objective over the frequency range 2fRF +/-fIFl2. The worst interference objective is selected. 
Potential problems associated with truncating the image response at that frequency range could arise causing error in the interference objective data, but in practical cases this situation is unlikely to occur. Furthermore, to be technically correct, the image CTX objective should be computed by adding the main co-chanD:el CTX objective to the replicated CTX objective (rather than comparing); however, since the level of the main objective is negligible as compared to the replicated objective, determining the image objective by comparing does not create significant errors. See Figure 8 for details on the frequency range and level of the CTX image and IF objectives. 
4.2 IF RESPONSE 
0 
The IF spurious response is a second order distortion product that can create an interference spectrum whose bandwidth is equal to the sum of the interferer and victim bandwidths (i.e., convolution of the interferer and victim PSD). The generated second order energy depends mainly on the receiver front end design and will be controlled if the energy at 'IF' response frequency can be maintained 10 to 20 dB below the receiver overload point, as measured at the receiver RF input port. As suppliers do not generally provide this type of information it will be difficult to get an exact objective. 
In the CTX model the IF response is accounted for by replicating the main co-channel objective shifted in frequency by fIF from the center frequency and by increasing the interference objective by an amount equal to the sum of 20 dB plus the RF filter response ( attenuation at the frequency shifted by fRF ± fIF/2). The worst objective is selected. The problems associated with truncating at fIF ± fIF/2 are exactly the same as those discussed in Section 4.1.

4.3 1/2 IF RESPONSE 
The 1/2 IF response is similar to the IF response except it results from higher order distortions. The treatment can be the same as for the IF response, but its effect proved to be insignificant. We chose to ignore the 1/2 IF response. 
5.0 INTERPRETATION OF DATA 
This section discusses input and output data. 
5.1 INTERFERER DIGITAL SPECTRUM 
Equipment suppliers provide transmitter PSD data, for specific equipment types over a limited frequency range. Their data is usually in graph form (transmitter PSD measured at the Radio Branching Network Antenna Port vs. Frequency) which is prepared from spectrum analyzer measurements. Since the CTX computer programs use subroutines that are efficient in terms of computing time and storage requirements a problem arises when supplier's data is used directly. This problem is linked to the limited frequency separation range of their PSD data and depends on the spectrum analyzer. The subroutines will compute CTX objectives which span a frequency range equal to the frequency range of the input data. Therefore, to compute CTX objectives over an extended range it will be necessary to extend the suppliers PSD data. 
Suppliers PSD data is usually in graph form and is typically limited to a frequency range of
) approximately 40 MHz from center frequency. In order to generate CTX objectives which extend beyond that frequency range it will be necessary to augment their data. We have chosen to augment their data using linear extrapolation. The extrapolation method suggested here involves choosing a data point corresponding to a PSD value which is 3 dB above the noise floor of the spectrum analyzer used by the manufacturer. The noise floor is identified as the portion of the PSD trace which shows a trend approaching a horizontal line ( at the tail ends of the spectrum). Using that point, truncate within a 0.1 MHz interval to a PSD level of -150 dBm/4kHz. The PSD is limited to a minimum value of -150 dBm/4kHz. This figure is used because its power. contribution to the total spectral power is negligible. 
5.2 VICTIM SELECTIVITY 
0 
This section discusses two methods which can be used to obtain victim filter data. These include a direct method using manufacturer's combined RF+ IF+ BB data and an indirect method using manufacturer's measured susceptibility to CW interference curve. 
5.2.1 Filter Data 
Equipment manufacturer's provide Receiver Sensitivity vs. Frequency Curves for specific equipment types. The frequency range varies between equipment manufacturers. And it is often necessary to extend the range of their data for the same reason as discussed in Section 5 .1. The method suggested for extending manufacturer's receive (victim) selectivity involves truncating the supplier's data from the last available point to 110 dB attenuation. Attenuation greater than 110 dB is not required. The 110 dB is an assumed maximum practical value agreed upon by FCSA Working Group U. Truncate the selectivity to 110 dB at 0.1 MHz beyond the last available selectivity information available from the supplier. 
5.2.2. Alternative Method For Obtaining Filter Data 
This section -discusses an alternate method to obtain victim filter characteristics by using manufacturer's susceptibility to CW interference data. Susceptibility to CW interference data is readily available from equipment manufacturers. Characterizing the victim frequency response (i.e., RF + IF + BB frequency response) based on using susceptibility to CW interference is the concept discussed here. 
Since the interfering RF signal is continuous wave (CW) with carrier frequency fc, it's normalized PSD is: 
(3) 

where: 
'I'!. (f)' is the Dirac delta function. For the same argument as discussed in Section 3.2.(1) the normalized PSD is referenced to 0 Hz. Therefore the interferer's normalized PSD is /'!, (f). Substituting I'!. (f) for s(f) in EQ 10 yields 
2
Icw(fs) 1: (f) IH(f -fs) 1 df = (0.259) (kTBF) EQ18 
where: 
Icw(fs) is the permissible interference CW power level. Therefore, 
Icw(fs) IH(-fs)l2 df= (0.259) (kTBF). EQ 19 
2
Since IH(-fs) = IH(fs) 12; i.e., the magnitude of the victim's filter transfer function is
1 
symmetrical, therefore the victim's combined RF+ IF+ BB filter power transfer function 2
I H(f) 1 , can be obtained from EQ 19. It follows that: 
IG(fs)l2 = (0.259) (kTBF) 
) EQ20 Icw(fs) 
Applying the 10 log operation to both sides of EQ 20 yields: 
10 log IH(fs) 12=10 log (0.259kTBF)-10 log ICW(fs) EQ21 
EQ 21 states that the power transfer function of the victim can be obtained by simply shifting the scale reference on the susceptibility to CW interference curve. Examples of susceptibility to CW interference and receiver selectivity (derived from receiver susceptibility curve) curves for a typical types -x receiver appear in Figure 9 and Figure 10 respectively. 
Note that the derived selectivity curve shown in Figure 10 resemble the Type -x receiver filter curve appearing in Figure 12. In the example of Figure 10, the level scale should be shifted to represent the bottom of the curve as 0 attenuation. The vertical scale then would read attenuation in dB relative to the bottom of the curve. The horizontal scale would not change and it would read frequency separation relative to the centre of the receiver passband.

5.3 MINIMUM CTX OBJECTIVE 
Our confidence of the accuracy of CTX objectives decreases with increasing frequency separation extending beyond the frequency range provided by the manufacturer's data. This is directly related to the uncertainty associated with the extrapolated PSD and selectivity data. The method chosen to extrapolate spectra and selectivity results in a maximum CTX objective of approximately 10 dBm. The extrapolation of spectrum data limits the spectrum power density to a minimum of -150 dBm and a maximum receiver filter attenuation of 110 dB at wide separations. 
6.0 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
The report discusses concepts used in the computer programs for CTX curve generation. These programs were developed to execute calculations efficiently. We conclude by giving on example of a DID interference case involving a type -x interferer and victim. Figures 11, 12, and 13 shows the interferer's PSD, victim's transfer function (RF + IF + BB) and the resulting CTX curve respectively. 
In preparing CTX curves, we found that it was easy to obtain suppliers transmitter PSD data and receiver RF and IF filter data; but, difficult to obtain the demodulator BB filter data. To overcome problems associated with procurement of filter data and combining the filter responses, we recommend using suppliers susceptibility to CW interference data as it contains the combined RF + IF + BB filter data (which is exactly what is required). We note that susceptibility to CW interference data is easier to obtain (and process) than filter data. To that end we recommend that suppliers be encouraged to provide susceptibility to CW interference data. Where suppliers provide specific CTX data this can be used for CTX curves for systems interfering into themselves i.e., like equipment, and for interfering into other equipment types.

Summary 
This report presents the theory required to develop objectives for interference between FM radio systems and a set ofFORTRAN subroutines which carry out the necessary calculations. 
It is shown that the computed results are quite accurate for low modulation index systems and tend to be somewhat conservative for intermediate modulation index systems. 
It should be noted that the emphasis in this work is directed towards the development of subroutines that are efficient in terms of computing time and storage requirements. Where necessary, accuracy is sacrificed in favour of this objective; however, wherever possible, approximations are designed to produce conservative results.

2. ASSUMPTIONS 
The worst baseband frequency (fch) is assumed to be: fch = fm1 / 2 or fm1 / 4, whichever is worse for f5 < fminJ 
fch = f5 or fm1 / 2 or fm1 / 4, whichever is worse for fminJ :, f5 < f5 < fm / 2 
1 fch = f5 for fm1 / 2:, f5 :, fm1 
fch = f5 -fminJ or fm1, whichever is worse for fm1 < f5 < fm1 + fmin]

The above assumptions are based on a number of sample calculations, the results ofwhich are tabulated below:

· In addition, the worst slot C/I for co-channel interference has been determined for desired and interfering channel loadings of 24, 60,120,300,600,960, 1200 and 1800 channels and combinations of these. The results indicate that the worst slot can be approximated by . fm1 I 2 or fm1 I 4, whichever is worse, to an accuracy ofat worst 1.1 dB in the computed C/I 
requirement. 
In fact, out ofa sample of 44 different combinations of desired and interfering channel loadings, 42 where better than or equal to 0.5 dB.

3.2 Large Modulation Index (m;c,,1.5):

The spectrum without emphasis is given by Hamer (Ref. 4), eq'n (4): 

The residual carrier is negligible. 
We neglect the effect of pre-emphasis on the spectrum. This is expected to be a conservative approach, as the effect of pre-emphasis is to decrease the spectral power at frequencies near the carrier where the spectral density is the greatest.

For intermediate values of m, noise power spectra based on measured data are normally used. Hamer (Ref. 4), figure 2, shows the normalized FM noise power spectra for values of m in the range 0.2 to 1.0. Tabulated values taken from Hamer's curves are reproduced below. The . spectrum for m=1.5 was calculated using the large modulation index approximation. 
0 To obtain intermediate values we interpolate linearly from these tables. Pre-emphasis is neglected again, except for the determination of the residual carrier component which is given by:

4. INTERFERENCE POWER SPECTRUM 
Given an arbitrary narrow-band signal interfering with an angle modulated carrier with arbitrary modulation, and provided that the interfering carrier amplitude is small w.r.t. the desired carrier amplitude, Pontano et al (Ref. 5, eq'n 7) shows that the resulting baseband interference power spectrum for a unity desired carrier amplitude is given by: 
where: 
and 
C2(-f-fs) = f_:P21(8) P1 1(-f -fs -8) d8 
= 2 t"P2 I (8)P1 I (-f -fs -8) d8 
Following Ref. 6, the above integrals can both be written in the form: 
where: ~ = f -fs or ~ = -f -fs 
Since the convolution integral is commutative: 
Here the limits of integration are reference to the absolute zero frequency. Changing to a relative frequency scale with its zero at the desired signal carrier frequency: 

5. INTERFERENCE INTO FM SYSTEMS 
The noise power ratio for C/I = 0, i.e., the ratio of the desired signal to the demodulated interference in a telephony channel centered at fch, is given by Pontano et al (Ref. 5, eq'n 14):

6. THRESHOLD DEGRADATION 
Short Haul: 
For a 1 dB degradation ofthe FM improvement threshold, the interference noise power will be 
5.87 dB below the front end thermal noise power at the input to the demodulator, i.e.: = lOlogKT+lOlogBW+F-5.87

= 10 log (1.374 x 10 x 291) + 10 logBW+F-5.87 = -174+10logBW+F-5.87 where BW is the noise bandwidth ofthe system in Herz. A design minimum bandwidth (maximum I) is 2 x (peak total deviation+ 2 x maximum modulating frequency) i.e.: 
where crp = 3.78 cr (per RSP-113) 
Long Haul: 
Allowing for a 40 dB fade margin and minimum carrier to interference of IO dB to avoid capture ofthe modulator by the interfering signal during fades of the desired signal, we have: 
C/Imin = 50 dB 
7. FILTER CHARACTERISTICS 
Filters are assumed to cut off at the design maximum half-bandwidth of 1.5 (crp+2fm) and roll off at 25 dB per octave to a maximum attenuation of 60 dB. i.e.:

) 
8. SPURIOUS RESPONSES 
We consider spurious responses at ±140 MHz (since the local oscillator may be either above or below the desired carrier), and ±70 MHz. We ignore spurious responses at ±35 MHz and ±105 MHz as these are expected to be down by the same order of magnitude as the assumed filter 
characteristics. The spurious responses at ± 140 MHz ±fm MHz are equal to the response at ±fm MHz, but attenuated by the assumed 60 dB image rejection. The spurious responses at ±70 ±fm MHz are conservatively estimated to be 20 dB down from the response at ±fm MHz in addition 
to the filter attenuation (see Ref. 2 and 7).

CHAPTER TWO 
OVERVIEW OF FREQUENCY COORDINATION 
2.1 INTRODUCTION 
Microwave radio stations, whether terrestrial or in the fixed-satellite service, need to be protected from interference caused by other such stations. Failure to do so can result in service degradation· or even interruption, and expensive plan alteration ranging up to total site relocation. 
The only practical way to avoid unacceptable interference is through calculations which predict the interference levels to be expected, supported on occasions by trial field measurements where the time and expense to do so is justified. 
The microwave interference calculation problem then, is to predict interference through calculations, with sufficient accuracy such that the risk of causing or experiencing unacceptable interference is compatible with the risk of the investment in the microwave plan involved, at minimum cost, within the time frames allowed by licensing procedures and system implementation schedules. 
) 
In the following paragraphs the common elements of terrestrial stations and earth stations will be defined and described. 
2.2 TYPES OF MICROWAVE STATIONS 
0 
Microwave stations can be divided into two main categories: Earth Stations (ES) and Terrestrial Stations (TS). 
Earth Station (ES): is defined as a station located either on the earth's surface or within the major portion of the earth's atmosphere (e.g. on a ship or an airplane) and intended for communications with one or more space stations, passive satellites or other objects in space. 
Terrestrial Station (TS): involve terrestrial radio communication which 1s radio communication other than space radio communications or radio astronomy. 
2.3. TYPES OF INTERFERENCE 
Interference is the effect of unwanted energy due to one or a combination of emission radiations or inductions upon reception in a radio communication system, manifested by any performance degradation, misinterpretation or loss of information which otherwise could be extracted in the absence of such unwanted energy. 
Acceptable interference level is the interference level that has been defined as permissible interference and which has been agreed upon between the Canadian Telecommunications Carriers. 
Interference into FDM-FM systems always cause both tones and noise whether or not the interfering signal is modulated. The interference FDM-FM phenomena can be divided into four types: (2.3.1 to 2.3.4 below). 
2.3.1 Intercarrier Beat 
) 
Co-channel intercarrier beat occurs when the frequency difference between the desired and interfering carriers cause a beat to fall within the desired baseband spectrum. Intercarrier beat 
occurs when the desired and interfering systems are lightly modulated or unmodulated. 
2.3.2 Sideband Beats 
Co-channel sideband beat occurs when the interfering carrier is so close to the desired carrier that the intercarrier beat is lower in frequency than all the traffic in the baseband. The resulting interference is not a single tone but a narrow band of noise. When the interference does not have sidebands, that is in the idle condition, a similar noise is generated from the crossproducts of the sidebands of the desired signal and the interfering carrier. 
Adjacent channel sideband beat occurs when the interfering and desired signals are so close together that their sidebands occupy the same frequency spectrum. Adjacent channel sideband beat interference occurs when both the desired and interfering systems are fully or nearly fully modulated. 
2.3.3 Threshold Degradation and Capture Effect 
0 
Threshold degradation occurs when the interfering signal arrives at the desired receiver at a level comparable to the front end thermal noise. Threshold level is considered to be the receiver input level that results in 54 dBrnCO of noise in the worst channel. A related phenomenon is capture of the demodulator by the interfering signal during fades of the desired signal. • 
2'.3.4 Spurious Response 
Spurious responses of the receiver can include all the mechanisms previously discussed and can occur at several frequencies greatly removed from the carrier frequency particularly at 70 MHz and 140 MHz. 
2.3.5 Interference into Digital Systems 
The effect of interference into digital receivers is controlled by the combination of RF, IF and 
Q BB filtering. The image response is affected by the RF filter only. In examining the signal processing operation of extracting BB from RF it is evident that the victim is essentially a low pass filter. Therefore, the victim sensitivity can be characterized by the combined frequency response of the receiver RF and IF filters and demodulator BB filter (the combined frequency response is referenced to OMHz) arranged in tandem. The victim sensitivity is defined in terms of its ( output power) / (input power) transfer function. 
2.4 INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS MODES 
Microwave stations may operate at different frequency bands or within the same band at different channel frequencies and under certain conditions ( coordination area, interference level) within the same frequency channel. Therefore as a "pre-cull" to eliminate cases of interference from further detailed analysis interference calculations could be performed in the following steps or modes. 
2.4.1 Band Analysis Mode (B) 
Band analysis assumes the stations under consideration operate in any frequency in their respective frequency bands without specifying any traffic and equipment types. The power levels for the calculations should be the minimum for the desired signal and the maximum for the interfering signal. Carrier to interference ratio (C/I) is calculated and tested against the required band ratio (C/I). This required band ratio C/I depends on the victim and interfering station. In Canada the FCSA members utilize the following band ratio C/I: 
) TS. TS C/I = 110 dB 
CI I = 95 dB for (0 -500 MHz) separation 
ES. TS. 
{ 
CI I = 0 dB above 500 MHz separation 
TS. ES CII = defined by the ES parameters. 
Band analysis can be used in the early system design stages when little is known about the interference environment or what frequency plan should be selected. The system is tested against a worst case requirement to guide further design. 

2.4.2 Channel Analysis Mode (C) 
0 
Interference cases not accepted in Band analyses (B) are subjected to channel analysis. Channel analysis is used to determine whether a channel will interfere with other existing channels. In the calculations the actual transmit powers, traffic types and equipment should be considered, the required interference level should be the appropriate one corresponding to the desired and interfering traffic types, receive equipment and frequency separation between the channels of the frequency plan involved. Interference is assessed on a C/I or I basis by comparing the calculated and required values. 
In the channel analysis mode (C) the required parameters for the calculations are available for the files of the existing systems. However in a case of a new system where some data are available and growth analysis is required, than a combination of'band (B) and channel (C) analysis can be used. That is the known parameters can be used as in the channel (C) analysis and the unknown parameters can be replaced by the worst case values defined in the band analysis (B). Examples of Band (B) and Channel (C) analysis modes are given in Chapters 3 and 4. 

2.5 INTERFERENCE CRITERIA 
Interference analysis calculations will provide the level of interference I or the carrier to interference ratio C/I which appears at the input of the receiver of the victim microwave station. This calculated level of interference I or the ratio C/I must be compared with the acceptable level of interference I or the C/I ratio required by the victim microwave receiver. 
Therefore, a basic requirement for interference analysis is the development of interference criteria. That is, for every possible combination of desired and undesired traffic types and receive equipment, a characteristic curve (called C/I curves) is required, which relates the maximum acceptable interference level I or the minimum acceptable carrier to interference ratio C/I for a given frequency separation. 
The C/I curves will enable the comparison of the calculated and required values of I or C/I and interference is considered to exist whenever 
)
Icalculated I,equried 
or 
(~)calculated < ( ~),equired 
) 
Derivation of the C/I curves involves the following steps: 
a) 
From the baseband noise objectives of the desired system, calculate the maximum acceptable level of interference in Watts or dBW at the input ofthe receiver. 

b) 
Convolution of the filtered desired and interfering power spectra densities will provide the interference power within the baseband cif the desired signal as a function of the frequency separations. 

c) 
For a given combination of desired and interfering traffic types and receive equipment characteristics, the calculated maximum acceptable interference power in step (a) and the relation between power and frequency separation calculated in step (b) will determine the required frequency separation between the frequencies of the desired and interfering signal. 


Figure 2.1 represents the general shape of an interference objective curve (C/I curve) arrived at 
by considering the four types of interference mec;hanisms described in Chapter 2.3. Detailed 
derivations ofthe C/I curves are given in Annex 2A.1 and 2A.2

2.6 TECHNICAL PARAMETERS 
The following parameters are required for interference calculations: 
2.6.1 Latitude and Longitude 
Victim and interfering microwave stations' latitudes and longitudes are required to determine ­path lengths, azimuths and discrimination angles. The required equations are given in Annex 2.B. 
2.6.2 Transmit Power (PTX) 
The output maximum power of the interfering station and the minimum transmit power in the desired microwave link. Reference point for PTX is the antenna input (antenna flange). 
) 
2.6.3 Antenna Feeder System Loss (AFSL) 
The sum of the waveguide and component losses due to the link between the antenna and the transmitter, and between the antenna and the receiver. 
2.6.4 Antenna Gain 
Manufacturers specified midband gain relative to isotropic radiator. Transmit gain = GTX, Receive gain= GRX. 

2.6.5 Antenna Radiation Pattern Envelopes 
0 
Radiation pattern envelopes are curves plotted on rectangular coordinates showing the minimum (worst) discrimination to be expected as a function of the off-axis angle. This discrimination is defined as off-axis discrimination. 
In some cases, radiation pattern envelopes will not be available and the only patterns available will be the actual (or typical) radiation patterns provided by the manufacturer. Usually, an actual or a typical pattern will be full of peaks and valleys. In such cases, the radiation pattern envelope for each actual pattern can be defined by drawing a smooth curve, or series of straight lines, enclosing all the peaks in the pattern. 
2.6.6 Antenna Peak-to-RMS Factor 
Antenna pattern envelope is based on straight line envelopes and hence the actual discrimination at a particular angle beyond the main lobe may actually be greater than the envelope peak value. In extreme hardship cases additional discrimination (peak-to RMS factor) is applied to antenna discrimination to reflect a more realistic value and is applicable only when all of the following 
Q 
conditions are met: 
1) Discrimination angles are greater than 5 degrees; 
2) Digital transmission is not involved; 
3) Interference is co-channel; 
4) Terrestrial system under consideration is longer than one hop. 
In Canada FCSA members utilize the following Peak-to-RMS Factors. 
Antenna Peak-to-RMS Factor 
1 horn 6 dB I dish 4dB 2 horns 9 dB 2 dishes 7 dB 1 horn+ 1 dish 8 dB 
2.6.7 Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) 
EIRP is defined as the sum in dB of the transmit power and antenna gain less the AFSL. 
EIRP = PTX (dBW) + GTX (dB) -AFSL (dB) 2.1 
2.6.8 Frequency Stability of Transmitter 
Manufacturer specified maximum frequency limits within which the unmodulated RF carrier could fall due to oscillator instability. 
2.6.9 Frequency Separation 
The actual frequency separation between the desired and interfering signal is taken to be the nominal frequency separation, minus or plus the sum of maximum frequency drifts whichever ) give the worst C/I or I requirements. In algebraic terms, the actual frequency separation f is
5 
given by the expression:

2.6.10 Desired and Interfering Channel Capacity 
For message channels, channel capacity is defined in terms of the number of telephone channels. For any other traffic types the channel capacity is defined as the equivalent number of telephone channels occupying the same bandwidth. 
2.6.11 Obstruction Loss 
From geographical maps, the relative elevation of the terrain and obstacles between the victim and interfering sites will provide the path profile. From the path profile one can determine if any blockage exist between the victim and interfering sites. If such a blockage exists, the interference level I will be decreased or the C/1 ratio will be increased by the obstruction loss over and above the free space loss under normal conditions.

2.7 DATA BASE REQUIREMENTS 
Effective frequency coordination can only be accomplished through a technical and administrative effort requiring the application of record keeping. 
The performance of microwave interference calculations involves: 
Data base manipulation and processing Technical calculation procedures. 
If each telecommunications carrier has designed his interference data base and calculations procedure in accordance with his resources, the amount of microwave plan to be protected, the number of new installations each year, and the number of new installations proposed by other domestic and foreign operators in and near the operating territory, then, the procedures which exist among the telecommunication carriers will range from complete inability to perform calculations, through hand calculations with minimal manual data base maintenance to computerized calculations and computer-aided manual data base maintenance. 
Because of the multiplicity of databases, calculation performed by a carrier in planning a new installation are repeated by the other carriers with whom the carrier is likely to interfere. In addition, the calculation methods used by each carrier are not, in general, identical. Therefore, the results obtained from individual calculations by different carriers are sometimes different 
) even when identical data are used. 
Data exchanges handled manually and the reconciliation of differences between carriers take significant engineering resources and delays agreement between users. 
The nature of these problems dictates the need of: 
A centralized Master Data Base, maintained on a time-share computer, accessible by all telecommunications carriers, containing the required information for interference calculation purposes. 
A standardized set of programs to be used with the above data, for calculating interference. 
The need for manual approaches to many problems is also recognized. In practice, a hybrid approach using a combination of computerized and manual techniques may be used for frequency coordination procedures.
